ColorIQ is a chrome extension that helps users match clothing pieces to their own “color
season”. This is based on the concept within the fashion industry of “seasonal color analysis”, or
the idea that certain colors mathematically look better on people based on their hair color, skin
tone, eye color, etc.

This app allows users to analyze clothing on their website, and match it against the user’s
self-defined color season.

make those primary tasks seamless and efficient
Information architecture - Organizing content and features in a logical hierarchy that
matches users' mental models
Progressive disclosure - Revealing complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users while
still providing access to advanced features
Visual hierarchy - Using size, color, contrast, and positioning to guide attention to the most
important elements first

cues that indicate how they work
Consistency - Maintaining uniform patterns, components, and interactions across screens
to reduce cognitive load
Accessibility - Ensuring the design works for users of all abilities (color contrast, screen
readers, keyboard navigation)
Error prevention - Designing to help users avoid mistakes before they happen rather than
just handling errors after they occur
Feedback - Providing clear signals when actions succeed or fail, and communicating
system status at all times
Performance considerations - Accounting for loading times and designing appropriate
loading states
Responsive design - Ensuring the interface works well across various screen sizes and
orientations
Platform conventions - Following established patterns from iOS/Android/Web to meet user
expectations
