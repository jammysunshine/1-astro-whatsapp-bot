    - **As a new user, I want a free initial reading that demonstrates personal relevance with button readings.** *Acceptance Criteria: Initial reading free and immediate, demonstrates accuracy with personal details, button access to reading, leads to further engagement.*
    - **As a potential user, I want to easily discover the service and initiate contact with button discovery.** *Acceptance Criteria: Clear discovery mechanisms (ads, referrals), easy WhatsApp initiation, button-based first interaction, low friction entry.*
- **Current Implementation**: The `conversationEngine.js` onboarding flow provides initial personalized responses and introduces elements like Sun Sign. The examples for bot experience in `INITIAL-PROMPT.md` show the desired interaction style.
- **Gaps for MVP**: Many elements under UX and Engagement are descriptions of desired behavior and content (e.g., "Storytelling Integration", "Emotional Validation") rather than tangible features demonstrated in the code. These would need to be implemented through careful crafting of conversational flows and message content.

### Epic 7: User Authentication & Profile Management
- **Goal**: Securely manage user identities and comprehensive astrological profiles, ensuring data privacy and personalized service delivery.
- **Key Features**: WhatsApp number verification, optional email/social login, two-factor authentication, and detailed user profile components (birth details, preferences, history).

    - As a user, I want to link my social media accounts for easier login with button linking.
- **Current Implementation**: `conversationEngine.js` directly calls `addBirthDetails` and `updateUserProfile` from `userModel` (though `userModel` itself isn't provided, its functions are called). This confirms the capability to collect and store birth data.
- **Gaps for MVP**: The actual implementation details of additional verification methods (email/social login, 2FA) are **not shown**. Data privacy settings are mentioned but not explicitly implemented in the provided code.

    - **As a user, I want to participate in community challenges during planetary events with button challenge participation.** *Acceptance Criteria: Challenges accessible via button, tied to planetary events, participation tracked, rewards for completion, community-wide engagement.*
- **Current Implementation**: `vedicCalculator.js` has a `checkCompatibility` method. `conversationEngine.js` has a `generate_compatibility` action that uses this. `INITIAL-PROMPT.md` outlines many social features.
- **Gaps for MVP**: A full "Astro-Social Network" with chat, profiles, and feeds, or advanced group reading features, are **not implemented** in the provided code and would require significant development. The social sharing mentioned primarily implies a user sharing externally, not within a platform social network.

### Epic 9: Gamification & User Engagement

    - **As a user, I want to track my achievements and progress within the platform.** *Acceptance Criteria: Achievement tracking accessible via button, progress metrics visible, historical achievements stored, gamification elements clear.*
- **Current Implementation**: Only mentions of "Achievement System" in `INITIAL-PROMPT.md` and basic concepts under "Gamification Elements". No direct code implementation for points, streaks, leaderboards, or unlockable content is shown.

- **Key Features**: MVP testing, A/B testing, churn analysis, competitive response strategies, regulatory compliance, security measures, and financial risk mitigation.
- **MVP User Stories**: None directly user-facing.
- **Current Implementation**: These are strategic points documented in `INITIAL-PROMPT.md`. Code would reflect security headers (helmet used in `server.js`) and middleware.
- **Gaps for MVP**: These are primarily documentation and strategic considerations, not directly code-implementable user stories.

### Epic 12: AI-Agent Driven Development & BMAd Methodology
- **Goal**: Leverage AI agents and the BMAd methodology for rapid, efficient, and high-quality development, ensuring continuous integration and automated quality assurance.
- **Key Features**: AI-Agent Driven Development, Qwen CLI, Gemini CLI, automated testing generation, AI code review, automated deployment, and BMAd project management.

    - **As a user, I want a seamless handover to a human astrologer when needed with button handover.** *Acceptance Criteria: Handover triggered by user request or AI detection, smooth transition without data loss, astrologer briefed on conversation history, user notified of handover.*
- **Current Implementation**: `conversationEngine.js` has a reference to `seamless handover to human astrologers when needed` in a User Interface & Interaction Design section, but no direct implementation is shown for connecting users to human astrologers.
- **Gaps for MVP**: The actual functionality of connecting to human astrologers, scheduling, and managing these interactions is **not implemented**.

### Epic 14: Advanced Technology & Infrastructure
- **Goal**: Implement advanced technological solutions and infrastructure to support complex features, high performance, and future innovation.
- **Key Features**: Social Graph Database, Loyalty System Engine, AI Twin System, Transit Timing Engine, and advanced analytics.
- **MVP User Stories**: This is an internal epic.
- **Current Implementation**: `INITIAL-PROMPT.md` lists these as features. The provided code has basic components (e.g., `vedicCalculator` for transit previews), but the advanced aspects are concepts.
- **Gaps for MVP**: Many of these are **not yet implemented** beyond basic data structures or placeholder functions.

### Epic 15: Success Metrics & KPIs
- **Goal**: Define and track key performance indicators and revenue metrics to measure project success, identify growth opportunities, and ensure profitability.
- **Key Features**: MRR, ARR, ARPU, CLV, conversion rates, engagement metrics, phase-based targets, and revenue optimization alerts.
- **MVP User Stories**: None directly user-facing. This is an internal epic.
- **Current Implementation**: These are strategic metrics outlined in `INITIAL-PROMPT.md`. Actual tracking and reporting mechanisms are not in the provided code snippets.
- **Gaps for MVP**: Not applicable as this is a meta-epic for tracking.

### Epic 16: Modular and Independent Architecture

- **Key Features**: Independent modules for features, conversation flows, and menus, ensuring plug-and-play architecture.
- **MVP User Stories**: None directly user-facing. This is an architectural guideline.
- **Current Implementation**: The directory structure (`src/config`, `src/controllers`, `src/conversation`, `src/services`, `src/utils`) suggests a modular approach. `conversationEngine.js` uses `getFlow` and `flowLoader` hinting at modular conversation flows.
- **Gaps for MVP**: Not applicable as this is an internal architectural epic.
