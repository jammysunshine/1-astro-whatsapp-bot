- Services with existing tests: 35
- Services missing tests: 72
- Current test coverage: ~32.7%

## Key Missing High-Priority Services:

Several important services from the MICROSERVICES_LIST.md are still missing tests, including:
- Core compatibility services (coupleCompatibilityService, synastryAnalysisService)
- Predictive services (vimshottariDashaService, solarReturnService)
- Specialized analysis services (shadbalaService, prashnaAstrologyService)
- Relationship services (compositeChartService, davisonChartService)

Creating tests for these missing services would significantly improve the overall test coverage and reliability of the astrological platform.
