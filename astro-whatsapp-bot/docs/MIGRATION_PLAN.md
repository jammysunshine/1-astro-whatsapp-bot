# Astro WhatsApp Bot - Code Migration Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating existing astrological service implementations and utility functions into the new architectural structure (`src/core/`, `src/interfaces/`, `src/adapters/`). The goal is to map each of the 90 identified microservices and shared helpers to their new locations, with detailed implementation guides for all services, prioritizing comprehensive implementations that leverage Swiss Ephemeris, `sweph`, and `astrologer` libraries.

**Refactoring Guideline Reminder:** This migration will strictly follow the "copy-first, deprecate-later" approach. Files will be copied, not moved, and original files will only be deprecated once the new, refactored service is fully functional and integrated.

**UPDATE:** This document has been revised to include detailed implementation guides for all 90 services, specifying the location of calculator files and providing step-by-step instructions for implementing each core service.

## üìä Current Implementation Status (Updated Accurate Status - November 2025)

**Total Services:** 90 microservices cataloged from menu tree
**Fully Implemented:** 83 services (92%) - Core service files with proper calculator integration in `/src/core/services/`
**Partially Implemented:** 0 services (0%) - All handlers exist and return actual data
**Missing Implementation:** 7 services (8%) - Core service files need creation in `/src/core/services/`

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Based on actual codebase analysis, we have a more accurate status. All calculation logic exists in `/src/services/astrology/vedic/calculators/` as world-class implementations with Swiss Ephemeris and astrologer libraries. All handlers exist in `/src/services/astrology/handlers/vedic/` and function properly. The actual implementation status shows 83 core service files in `/src/core/services/` are implemented, while only 7 remain missing.

## 1. Microservices Mapping (from MICROSERVICES_LIST.md)

Each entry below represents a microservice. We will identify its source in the existing codebase and its target file in the new `src/core/services/` structure.

**IMPORTANT:** Each microservice must be implemented as an independent service file with clear separation of concerns. No single file should contain multiple unrelated microservices.

### Implementation Guidelines:
- **Calculator-first approach:** Leverage existing world-class calculator implementations with Swiss Ephemeris
- **Core service implementation:** Each core service file connects to one or more calculator implementations
- **Proper separation:** Maintain clear separation between handlers, core services, and calculators
- **Test after each:** Validate functionality before moving to next service
- **Gradual migration:** Update action classes to use new core services incrementally
- **Priority-based execution:** Focus on HIGH priority services first for maximum impact
- **Follow implementation guides:** Each service entry includes specific implementation instructions

## 6. General Implementation Guidelines for All Services

### Core Service Implementation Framework

Every core service should follow this standard implementation pattern:

1. **Import Dependencies:**
   ```javascript
   const CalculatorClass = require('../../services/astrology/vedic/calculators/CalculatorClass');
   const logger = require('../../../utils/logger');
   ```

2. **Service Class Definition:**
   ```javascript
   class ServiceNameService {
     constructor() {
       this.calculator = new CalculatorClass();
       logger.info('ServiceNameService initialized');
     }
     
     async execute(birthData) {
       try {
         // Input validation
         this._validateInput(birthData);
         
         // Call calculator method
         const result = await this.calculator.calculateMethod(birthData);
         
         // Format and return result
         return this._formatResult(result);
       } catch (error) {
         logger.error('ServiceNameService error:', error);
         throw new Error(`Service execution failed: ${error.message}`);
       }
     }
     
     _validateInput(input) {
       // Validation logic
     }
     
     _formatResult(result) {
       // Formatting logic
       return result;
     }
   }
   
   module.exports = ServiceNameService;
   ```

### Connection Patterns Between Layers

1. **Handler to Core Service:**
   - Handlers should instantiate and call core services
   - Pass validated user input to core services
   - Handle service responses and format for user interface

2. **Core Service to Calculator:**
   - Core services should instantiate and call specific calculator classes
   - Pass processed data to calculator methods
   - Handle calculator responses and format appropriately

3. **Error Handling:**
   - All services should implement try/catch blocks
   - Log errors with appropriate context
   - Return user-friendly error messages
   - Gracefully handle missing or invalid data

### Data Flow Standards

1. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate all required fields are present
   - Check data types and formats
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs

2. **Processing:**
   - Transform user input into calculator-compatible format
   - Call appropriate calculator methods
   - Handle asynchronous operations correctly

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - Format results for clear presentation
   - Include relevant contextual information
   - Provide interpretation where appropriate

### Testing Requirements

Each core service should include:

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Test with valid input data
   - Test error conditions
   - Test edge cases
   - Mock calculator dependencies

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test connection to actual calculators
   - Validate output formats
   - Test performance with real data

3. **Validation Tests:**
   - Verify calculation accuracy
   - Test with known benchmark data
   - Validate Swiss Ephemeris integration

### Documentation Standards

Each service should document:

1. **Purpose and Scope:**
   - Clear description of what the service does
   - Astrological principles applied
   - Expected use cases

2. **Input Requirements:**
   - Required data fields
   - Data format specifications
   - Validation rules

3. **Output Specifications:**
   - Result structure
   - Interpretation guidelines
   - Error conditions

4. **Dependencies:**
   - Calculator classes used
   - External libraries
   - Configuration requirements

By following these guidelines, all core services will maintain consistency in implementation while properly connecting the handler layer to the calculator layer, ensuring reliable and maintainable astrological analysis capabilities.
