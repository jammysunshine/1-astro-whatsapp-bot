   railway up      # Deploy changes
   railway logs    # Monitor deployment
   railway domain  # Confirm domain
   curl https://[domain]/health  # Verify health
   ```

2. **NEVER SKIP DEPLOYMENT** - Even for "minor" changes
3. **VERIFY FUNCTIONALITY** - Test WhatsApp integration after deployment
4. **REPORT STATUS** - Confirm deployment success to user

**CONSEQUENCE OF VIOLATION:** Production system becomes outdated, bugs persist in live environment, user experience degraded.
