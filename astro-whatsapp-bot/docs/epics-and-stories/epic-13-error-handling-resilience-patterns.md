# Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## Description

Implement comprehensive error handling and resilience patterns following BMAD methodology and gemini.md mandates. This epic is ESSENTIAL for solo developer success as it ensures system reliability and eliminates manual error handling burden through automated resilience mechanisms.

## Features Included

- Graceful degradation implementation with service continuity
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation with state management
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and jitter
- Fallback mechanisms and alternative paths with graceful degradation
- Comprehensive error logging and context with debugging information
- Error classification and handling with appropriate responses
- Timeout management for external requests with failure handling
- Health check endpoints implementation with system status monitoring
- Service degradation and fallback strategies with user notification
- Error recovery and auto-healing with self-correction mechanisms
- Dead letter queues for failed messages with retry processing
- Circuit breaker states and transitions with proper monitoring
- Graceful shutdown procedures with resource cleanup
- Resource cleanup on error conditions with memory management
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
