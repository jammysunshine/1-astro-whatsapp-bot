# Epic 14: Logging, Alerting & Observability

## Description

Implement comprehensive logging, alerting, and observability infrastructure following BMAD methodology and gemini.md mandates. This epic focuses on structured logging, metrics collection, alerting systems, and distributed tracing for system transparency and incident response. (Note: Performance optimization is covered in Epic 12, infrastructure monitoring in Epic 20.)

## Features Included

- Structured logging implementation with consistent formatting
- Centralized logging solution with searchable archives
- Log level configuration and management with dynamic adjustment
- Log aggregation and analysis with pattern recognition
- Metrics collection and monitoring with real-time dashboards
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) with performance insights
- Alerting systems and notification with escalation paths
- Health check endpoints with system status monitoring
- Distributed tracing implementation with request flow tracking
- Log rotation and retention policies with storage optimization
- Log security and access control with audit trails
- Real-time log streaming with live monitoring
- Log search and query capabilities with advanced filtering
- Dashboard and visualization with customizable views
- Incident response and debugging with troubleshooting tools

## Business Value

CRITICAL for solo developer success - eliminates manual monitoring burden and ensures system transparency with zero manual observability effort through automated logging and monitoring.
