# Epic 1: Payment Integration Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Enable secure, region-specific payment processing and gateway integration for Indian and international users while maintaining existing bot functionality and ensuring backward compatibility with current payment simulation. (Note: Content monetization strategies are covered in Epic 8.)

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current payment system uses simulation mode
- Bot supports users in India, UAE, and Australia
- Existing payment flow: user selects service → payment simulation → confirmation

**Enhancement Details:**
- Integrate Razorpay for Indian payments (UPI, PayTM, cards)
- Integrate Stripe for UAE/Australia payments (cards)
- Implement region-based payment method selection
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Maintain existing bot functionality during transition

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Razorpay Integration Setup
As a developer,
I want to set up Razorpay integration for Indian payments,
So that users in India can make real payments via UPI, PayTM, and cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Razorpay account created and API keys configured
2. Payment service updated to use Razorpay for Indian users
3. UPI, PayTM, and card payment methods enabled
4. Existing payment simulation remains functional during setup

#### Integration Verification
1. Existing bot functionality continues to work unchanged
2. Payment service maintains current API interface
3. No breaking changes to existing payment flow

### Story 1.2: Stripe Integration Setup
As a developer,
I want to set up Stripe integration for international payments,
So that users in UAE and Australia can make real payments via cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Stripe account created and API keys configured
2. Payment service updated to use Stripe for UAE/Australia users
3. Card payment methods enabled for international users
4. Existing payment simulation remains functional during setup

#### Integration Verification
1. Existing bot functionality continues to work unchanged
2. Payment service maintains current API interface
3. No breaking changes to existing payment flow

### Story 1.3: Region-Based Payment Selection
As a user,
I want the bot to automatically select the appropriate payment gateway based on my location,
So that I see relevant payment methods for my region.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User region detection implemented (India/UAE/Australia)
2. Payment method selection logic based on region
3. Indian users see UPI/PayTM/card options via Razorpay
4. UAE/Australia users see card options via Stripe
5. Fallback to simulation if region detection fails

#### Integration Verification
1. Existing payment flow logic remains intact
2. Bot continues to function for all users
3. No impact on non-payment features

### Story 1.4: Payment Error Handling & User Feedback
As a user,
I want clear feedback when payment issues occur,
So that I understand what went wrong and how to resolve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Comprehensive error handling for payment failures
2. User-friendly error messages in bot responses
3. Proper logging of payment errors for debugging
4. Graceful fallback to simulation on payment gateway failures
5. Retry mechanisms for transient failures

#### Integration Verification
1. Existing error handling patterns maintained
2. Bot stability not affected by payment failures
3. User experience improved without breaking existing flows

### Story 1.5: Payment Flow End-to-End Testing
As a developer,
I want to test complete payment flows with real transactions,
So that I ensure the integration works correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Test payment flows with real Razorpay transactions
2. Test payment flows with real Stripe transactions
3. Region-based selection tested for all supported regions
4. Error scenarios tested and handled properly
5. Performance and security validation completed

#### Integration Verification
1. All existing functionality verified through testing
2. Payment integration does not introduce regressions
3. Bot performance maintained under payment load

## Compatibility Requirements
- [ ] Existing payment simulation API remains unchanged
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] Bot response formats maintained for existing integrations
- [ ] No breaking changes to user-facing bot behavior

## Risk Mitigation
**Primary Risk:** Payment gateway failures could disrupt bot functionality
**Mitigation:** Implement fallback to simulation mode with user notification
**Rollback Plan:** Revert to simulation-only mode by disabling gateway integrations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing bot functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Payment integrations working for all supported regions
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback implemented
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed with real transactions
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
