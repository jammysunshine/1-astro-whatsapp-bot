# Epic 20: Infrastructure Monitoring & Availability

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive infrastructure monitoring and availability management to ensure system reliability and uptime for the astrology WhatsApp bot.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Infrastructure not systematically monitored
- No automated availability management
- Basic system health checks

**Enhancement Details:**

- Infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- High availability and failover systems
- Automated scaling and resource management
- System availability and uptime tracking

## Stories

### Story 20.1: Application Performance Monitoring

As a DevOps engineer,
I want application performance monitoring,
So that I can identify and resolve bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. APM tools tracking response times and error rates
2. Resource usage monitoring and alerts
3. Detailed transaction tracing implemented
4. Performance dashboards with actionable insights

#### Integration Verification

1. APM doesn't impact application performance
2. Monitoring data accurate and timely
3. Alerts configurable and reliable

### Story 20.2: Infrastructure Monitoring

As a system administrator,
I want infrastructure monitoring,
So that I can ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Server monitoring for CPU, memory, disk usage
2. Database performance tracking and optimization
3. Automated scaling based on load metrics
4. Infrastructure health dashboards

#### Integration Verification

1. Monitoring covers all critical components
2. Scaling triggers appropriate and timely
3. Health data accessible for troubleshooting

### Story 20.3: Automated Performance Testing

As a developer,
I want automated performance testing,
So that I can catch regressions before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Performance benchmarks for critical paths
2. Automated load testing integrated in CI/CD
3. Performance regression detection
4. Test results integrated with monitoring

#### Integration Verification

1. Tests run automatically on deployments
2. Regression detection accurate
3. Test results accessible to team

### Story 20.4: Response Time Optimization

As a user,
I want fast response times,
So that I receive astrology insights quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. 95% of requests respond within 2 seconds
2. Progressive loading for complex charts
3. Caching for frequently accessed data
4. Performance optimization recommendations

#### Integration Verification

1. Response times meet SLAs
2. Caching doesn't serve stale data
3. Progressive loading improves perceived performance

## Compatibility Requirements
