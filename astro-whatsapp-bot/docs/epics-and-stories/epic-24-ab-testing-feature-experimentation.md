# Epic 24: A/B Testing & Feature Experimentation

## Epic Goal
Implement systematic experimentation to optimize user experience, conversion rates, and feature adoption for the astrology WhatsApp bot.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- No A/B testing capabilities
- Feature rollouts not controlled
- Limited experimentation framework

**Enhancement Details:**
- Feature flag management system
- Statistical analysis for experiments
- Controlled feature rollouts
- Experiment tracking and optimization

## Stories

### Story 24.1: Feature Flags System
As a product manager,
I want feature flags,
So that I can roll out features gradually and control access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. Percentage-based rollouts supported
3. Instant flag toggling capabilities
4. Flag targeting by user segments

#### Integration Verification
1. Flags don't impact performance
2. Rollouts controlled and gradual
3. Targeting works accurately

### Story 24.2: Experiment Analytics
As a data scientist,
I want experiment analytics,
So that I can measure the impact of changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Statistical significance testing implemented
2. Confidence intervals calculated
3. Experiment result dashboards created
4. Conversion funnel analysis available

#### Integration Verification
1. Analytics accurate and reliable
2. Statistical tests correct
3. Dashboards provide insights

### Story 24.3: Optimized User Experiences
As a user,
I want optimized experiences,
So that I receive the best version of features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Continuous A/B testing of onboarding flows
2. Pricing display optimization
3. Content presentation testing
4. User experience improvements based on data

#### Integration Verification
1. Testing doesn't disrupt user experience
2. Optimizations improve key metrics
3. Changes rolled out safely

### Story 24.4: Experiment Tracking
As a developer,
I want experiment tracking,
So that I can correlate code changes with user behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria
