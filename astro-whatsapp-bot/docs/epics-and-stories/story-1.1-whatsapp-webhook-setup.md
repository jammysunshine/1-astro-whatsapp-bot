# Story 1.1: WhatsApp Webhook Setup

## Epic
Epic 1: Core WhatsApp Integration

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to send messages to the astrology bot via WhatsApp so that I can get astrological readings and guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] WhatsApp Business API webhook is properly configured and receiving messages
- [x] Incoming messages are parsed and validated correctly
- [x] Basic health check endpoint is available at /health
- [x] Webhook endpoint is available at /webhook and processes POST requests
- [x] Error handling is in place for webhook failures
- [x] Rate limiting is implemented to comply with WhatsApp API limits
- [x] OpenAPI specification documented for webhook endpoints (BMAd enterprise artifact)
- [x] Security architecture review completed with vulnerability assessment (BMAd compliance)
- [x] Performance benchmarks established for message throughput (BMAd quality standard)
- [x] Comprehensive logging and monitoring implemented (BMAd observability requirement)

## Technical Requirements
- Use Express.js server with proper middleware
- Implement proper request parsing for both JSON and form data
- Include raw body parsing for signature verification
- Add proper error handling middleware

## Dependencies
- WhatsApp Business API account and credentials

## Priority
Critical - Foundation for all other features

## Story Points
8

## Status
COMPLETED - 100% Implementation finished and tested

## BMAd Compliance
- **System Architect Agent**: API contract specifications defined with exact endpoint specifications (/webhook, /health), security foundations with signature verification, and technology stack decisions (Express.js, middleware configuration)
- **Implementation & Development Agent**: Feature implementation with enterprise design patterns, error handling and resilience patterns, comprehensive error logging and context
- **Quality Assurance & Testing Agent**: Automated testing suite for webhook validation, API contract testing, and integration testing for external services
- **Security & Compliance Agent**: Webhook validation and signature verification, rate limiting and DoS protection, compliance with WhatsApp API security requirements
- **Deployment & Infrastructure Agent**: Infrastructure-as-Code for webhook deployment, automated health checks with alerting, zero-downtime deployment considerations

## Enterprise Artifacts Produced
- API documentation with OpenAPI specifications for webhook endpoints
- Security architecture review for webhook implementation
- Performance benchmarks for message processing throughput
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring setup for webhook operations

## BMAd Phase Integration
- **AI-First Development**: Leverages Qwen CLI and Gemini CLI for rapid architectural design and code generation of webhook infrastructure with enterprise patterns
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Enables quick iteration on webhook configurations through AI-powered prototyping and immediate feedback loops
- **Continuous Learning**: Incorporates feedback from webhook performance metrics to continuously optimize message processing and error handling
- **Coordinated AI Agents**: Seamless handoff between System Architect (API design), Implementation (code generation), and Security agents (validation)

## AI Agent Coordination Handoffs
- **System Architect → Implementation & Development**: API contracts and data models handed off for code generation
- **Implementation & Development → Quality Assurance**: Completed webhook implementation handed off for comprehensive testing
- **Security & Compliance → Deployment & Infrastructure**: Security-validated code handed off for production deployment
- **Cross-Epic Dependencies**: Provides foundation for Epic 2 (astrology calculations) and Epic 3 (subscription system) message processing
