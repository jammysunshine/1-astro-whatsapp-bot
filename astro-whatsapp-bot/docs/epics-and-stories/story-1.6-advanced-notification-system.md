## Dev Notes
### Architecture Context
- **Transit Timing Engine**: This story directly implements the "Event-based notification system" component.
- **AI Twin System**: The "Personalized AI astrologer with conversational memory" and "Learning from user preferences and interaction patterns" will be crucial for generating personalized and context-aware notifications.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: A multi-channel notification service will be used for efficient notification delivery.
- **Multi-Language Technology Stack**: Localization tools will be essential for time zone handling and culturally appropriate notifications.
- **Security & Compliance**: "Data Privacy: Secure handling of birth information and personal data" is critical for personalized notifications.

### Implementation Guidance
- **Notification Scheduling**: Implement a robust notification scheduling system capable of handling daily, weekly, and event-based triggers. Consider using a message queue for reliable delivery.
- **Personalization Engine**: Develop a personalization engine that leverages user profile data (birth chart, preferences) and transit calculations to generate highly relevant cosmic tips, lucky numbers, and decision timing advice.
- **User Preference Management**: Implement a comprehensive system for users to manage their notification settings, including frequency, types, do-not-disturb options, and opt-in/out.
- **Content Generation**: Develop templates for emotional support messages and storytelling elements, ensuring they are dynamic and can incorporate personalized astrological data.
- **Time Zone Handling**: Implement accurate time zone handling and localization to deliver notifications at the correct local time for each user.

## Testing
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write unit tests for notification scheduling logic, personalization engine components, and user preference management *before* implementing the code.
- **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions for notification generation, time zone conversion, and preference application.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the interaction between the notification system, user profile, transit calculation engine, and WhatsApp messaging system.
- **Acceptance Criteria Validation**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are covered by automated tests, including testing various notification types, personalization scenarios, and user preference settings.
