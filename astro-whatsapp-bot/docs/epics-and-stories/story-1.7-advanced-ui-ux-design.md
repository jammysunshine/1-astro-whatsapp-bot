## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

- **WhatsApp Business API Integration**: This story is central to "Message processing and response generation" and enhancing user interaction within WhatsApp.
- **AI Twin System**: The "Personalized AI astrologer with conversational memory", "Natural language processing for astrology queries", and "Personality adaptation based on user communication style" are directly leveraged for the conversational design and personalized interaction style.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: "AI Services: OpenAI API or similar for AI Twin conversations" will be the backbone for conversational AI and context-aware responses.
- **Multi-Language Technology Stack**: NLP capabilities will support varied user question formats.
- **Multi-Channel Delivery System**: The "WhatsApp-first architecture" will be the primary focus for implementing these UI/UX elements.

### Implementation Guidance

- **Conversational AI**: Implement a conversational AI layer that integrates with the AI Twin system to understand user intent from varied inputs and generate context-aware responses.
- **Context Management**: Develop a robust context management system to track conversation history and user preferences, enabling personalized interactions.
- **Menu & Quick Replies**: Design and implement a flexible menu system and quick-reply button generation to facilitate intuitive navigation within WhatsApp.
- **Visual Media Integration**: Integrate capabilities for delivering personalized and engaging visual media (e.g., birth charts, images) to enhance the user experience.
- **Human Handover**: Implement a seamless handover mechanism to human astrologers, ensuring a smooth transition for complex queries.
- **Bot Personality**: Develop algorithms for personality adaptation and tone matching to align with the "Distinct, warm, and wise bot personality" goal.

## Testing

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write unit tests for conversational AI components, context management, and menu system logic _before_ implementing the code.
- **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions for NLP processing, response generation, and quick-reply button logic.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the interaction between the WhatsApp API, AI Twin system, and user profile system for personalized and contextual responses.
- **User Experience Tests**: Conduct manual and automated tests to validate intuitive navigation, conversational flow, and visual media integration within WhatsApp.
- **Acceptance Criteria Validation**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are covered by automated tests, including testing various user interaction scenarios and personalized responses.
