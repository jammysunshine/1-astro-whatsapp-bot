## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

- **WhatsApp Business API Integration**: This story leverages "Message processing and response generation" and "Media handling for kundli sharing" for delivering the onboarding flow and visually engaging content.
- **AI Twin System**: The "Personalized AI astrologer with conversational memory" and "Learning from user preferences and interaction patterns" will be crucial for tailoring the onboarding experience and generating personalized content.
- **Multi-System Astrology Engine**: Birth chart generation and personalized readings will utilize the capabilities of this engine.
- **User Management System**: Profile creation and user preference collection are directly supported by this system.
- **Multi-Channel Delivery System**: "Content Management: Content management system for cross-platform content delivery" and "Visualization: Kundli/kundli visualization engine for multiple formats" are key for educational and visually engaging content.

### Implementation Guidance

- **Onboarding Flow**: Design a clear, step-by-step onboarding flow that guides new users through profile creation and introduces core features. Prioritize immediate value delivery.
- **Personalized Content**: Implement a personalized reading generation system that leverages birth chart data and AI Twin capabilities to create high-value, emotionally resonant content for the immediate value hook.
- **Educational Content Management**: Develop an educational content management system to store and deliver beginner's guides, glossaries, and video tutorials. Ensure content is easily accessible and digestible.
- **Limited-Time Access**: Implement a mechanism for granting and managing limited-time premium access, ensuring proper tracking and expiry.
- **Social Integration**: Integrate social features (e.g., compatibility checking with friends) early in the onboarding process to encourage viral growth.

## Testing

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write unit tests for onboarding flow logic, personalized reading generation, and limited-time access management _before_ implementing the code.
- **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions for content generation, preference collection, and access control.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the seamless flow of the onboarding process, including profile creation, content delivery, and feature access.
- **User Experience Tests**: Conduct manual and automated tests to validate the intuitiveness, engagement, and effectiveness of the onboarding experience.
- **Acceptance Criteria Validation**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are covered by automated tests, including testing the immediate value hook and limited-time premium access.
