Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want an automated CI/CD pipeline configured for the project so that code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A CI/CD pipeline is configured using a suitable platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
- [ ] The pipeline automatically triggers on code commits to designated branches.
- [ ] The pipeline includes stages for code checkout, dependency installation, and build.
- [ ] The pipeline integrates with version control for source code management.
- [ ] Pipeline status is clearly visible and notifications are sent on success/failure.
- [ ] The pipeline configuration is version-controlled and auditable.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure a CI/CD platform.
- Define pipeline stages in a configuration file (e.g., .github/workflows/main.yml).
- Ensure necessary build tools and environments are available in the pipeline runners.
- Integrate with code quality and static analysis tools.
- Set up notifications for pipeline events.

## Dependencies

- Version control system (Git).
- Project build tools and scripts.
- Code quality tools.

## Priority

Critical - Foundation for automated development and deployment.
