# Story 10.11: Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

## Epic

Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement a blue-green deployment strategy so that new versions of the application can be deployed with zero downtime and minimal risk.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The deployment pipeline supports maintaining two identical production environments (blue and green).
- [ ] New releases are deployed to the inactive environment (green) while the active environment (blue) serves traffic.
- [ ] Traffic can be switched instantly from the old (blue) to the new (green) environment.
- [ ] The old environment (blue) is kept as a rollback option.
- [ ] Deployments to the green environment are fully validated before traffic switch.
- [ ] The blue-green deployment process is automated and auditable.

## Technical Requirements

- Configure infrastructure to support two identical production environments.
- Implement a load balancer or traffic routing mechanism to switch traffic between environments.
- Automate the deployment of new versions to the inactive environment.
- Integrate health checks and post-deployment validation into the blue-green process.
- Develop scripts or tools for managing the blue-green switch and rollback.

## Dependencies

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation (Story 10.8).
- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).
- Automated health checks (Story 10.14).

## Priority

High - Ensures zero-downtime deployments and reduces risk.
