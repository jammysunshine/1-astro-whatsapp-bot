Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want to implement a canary release strategy so that new application versions can be gradually rolled out to a small subset of users, minimizing the impact of potential issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The deployment pipeline supports deploying new versions to a small group of users (canary).
- [ ] Traffic can be gradually shifted to the canary release based on predefined metrics.
- [ ] Automated monitoring and alerting are in place to detect issues in the canary environment.
- [ ] The ability to quickly roll back traffic from the canary to the stable version is implemented.
- [ ] The canary release process is automated and auditable.
- [ ] The impact of new features can be observed on a small user base before full rollout.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement traffic routing mechanisms (e.g., load balancer rules, service mesh) to direct a percentage of users to the canary.
- Automate the deployment of the new version to the canary environment.
- Integrate monitoring and alerting systems to track the health and performance of the canary.
- Develop scripts or tools for managing traffic shifting and rollback.
- Define clear metrics and thresholds for promoting or rolling back the canary.

## Dependencies

- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).
- Automated health checks (Story 10.14).
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).

## Priority

High - Reduces risk of new feature rollouts and enables controlled experimentation.
