# Story 10.13: Zero-Downtime Deployment with Health Checks

## Epic

Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want to achieve zero-downtime deployments with robust health checks so that users experience continuous service availability during application updates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Application deployments occur without any service interruption for end-users.
- [ ] Automated health checks verify the readiness and liveness of new application instances before routing traffic.
- [ ] Old application instances are gracefully drained of traffic and shut down only after new instances are fully healthy.
- [ ] The deployment process automatically retries or rolls back if health checks fail.
- [ ] The zero-downtime deployment mechanism is integrated into the automated pipeline.
- [ ] Monitoring confirms continuous service availability during deployments.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement readiness and liveness probes for application containers/instances.
- Configure load balancers or service meshes to perform rolling updates and traffic shifting.
- Ensure application instances can start quickly and handle graceful shutdowns.
- Integrate health check status into the deployment pipeline for decision-making.
- Develop strategies for database schema changes that are backward and forward compatible.

## Dependencies

- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).
- Automated health checks (Story 10.14).
- Load balancing or service mesh infrastructure.

## Priority

Critical - Ensures high availability and seamless user experience.
