# Story 10.14: Automated Health Checks with Alerting

## Epic

Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a system administrator, I want automated health checks with integrated alerting so that I am immediately notified of any service degradation or outages, enabling rapid response and resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Health check endpoints are implemented for all critical services.
- [ ] Automated monitoring continuously pings health check endpoints.
- [ ] Alerts are triggered and sent to the operations team when health checks fail.
- [ ] Health check responses provide sufficient information for initial diagnosis.
- [ ] The alerting system has configurable thresholds and notification channels.
- [ ] Health check failures can automatically trigger rollback procedures.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement `/health` or `/status` endpoints for all microservices/components.
- Configure a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Nagios, cloud provider monitoring) to poll these endpoints.
- Set up alerting rules and integrate with notification services (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack, email).
- Ensure health checks cover critical dependencies (e.g., database connectivity, external API reachability).
- Document health check endpoints and expected responses.

## Dependencies

- Critical application services.
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).
- Rollback procedures (Story 10.5).

## Priority

Critical - Ensures system availability and rapid incident response.
