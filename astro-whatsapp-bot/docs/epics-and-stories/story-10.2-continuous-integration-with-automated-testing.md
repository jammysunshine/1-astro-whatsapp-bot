Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a developer, I want continuous integration with automated testing so that every code change is automatically validated for correctness and quality before being merged into the main codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The CI pipeline automatically executes all unit, integration, and E2E tests on every code push.
- [ ] The pipeline fails if any test suite reports failures.
- [ ] Code quality checks (linting, static analysis) are integrated and enforced.
- [ ] Test results and code quality reports are accessible within the CI/CD platform.
- [ ] Build artifacts are generated and stored for successful builds.
- [ ] The CI process provides fast feedback to developers on code changes.

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate all test suites (unit, integration, E2E) into the CI pipeline stages.
- Configure code quality tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube) to run in CI.
- Set up artifact storage for successful builds.
- Optimize test execution speed within the CI environment.
- Ensure proper reporting of test and code quality results.

## Dependencies

- Automated CI/CD pipeline configuration (Story 10.1).
- Automated testing suite (Epic 9).
- Code quality tools.

## Priority

Critical - Ensures code quality and prevents regressions.
