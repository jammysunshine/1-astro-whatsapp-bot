Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want continuous deployment with automated quality gates so that validated code changes are automatically deployed to production environments, ensuring only high-quality releases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Code that passes all CI checks and quality gates is automatically deployed to staging.
- [ ] Manual approval gates are implemented for deployment to production.
- [ ] Quality gates enforce predefined metrics (e.g., test coverage, security scan results, performance benchmarks).
- [ ] The deployment pipeline provides clear visibility into the deployment status.
- [ ] Automated notifications are sent on deployment success or failure.
- [ ] The deployment process is fully automated with zero manual intervention required after approval.

## Technical Requirements

- Configure the CI/CD pipeline to include deployment stages to various environments.
- Define and implement quality gates based on project metrics and standards.
- Integrate with deployment tools and cloud providers (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS, Vercel).
- Implement approval mechanisms for production deployments.
- Ensure secure access to deployment environments.

## Dependencies

- Continuous Integration with Automated Testing (Story 10.2).
- Automated testing suite (Epic 9).
- Quality gate definitions (Epic 9, 11, 12).

## Priority

Critical - Ensures rapid and reliable delivery of features.
