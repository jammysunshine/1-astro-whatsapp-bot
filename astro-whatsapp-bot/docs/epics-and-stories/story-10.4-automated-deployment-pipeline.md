Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want a fully automated deployment pipeline so that application releases are consistent, repeatable, and efficient across all environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The deployment pipeline automates all steps from build artifact to running application.
- [ ] Deployments are consistent across development, staging, and production environments.
- [ ] The pipeline supports deploying different types of application components (e.g., backend services, frontend assets, database migrations).
- [ ] Deployment status and logs are easily accessible.
- [ ] The pipeline ensures that all necessary configurations are applied correctly for each environment.
- [ ] The deployment process is auditable and provides a clear history of changes.

## Technical Requirements

- Script all deployment steps using tools like Ansible, Terraform, or custom shell scripts.
- Integrate with cloud provider APIs or container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes).
- Implement environment-specific configuration management.
- Ensure secure handling of credentials and sensitive information during deployment.
- Develop monitoring and alerting for deployment failures.

## Dependencies

- Continuous Deployment with Quality Gates (Story 10.3).
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation (Story 10.8).
- Automated provisioning and configuration management (Story 10.9).

## Priority

Critical - Ensures consistent and reliable application delivery.
