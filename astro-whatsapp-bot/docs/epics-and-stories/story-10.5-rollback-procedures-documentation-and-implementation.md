Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want documented and automated rollback procedures so that I can quickly revert to a previous stable version of the application in case of critical issues during or after deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rollback procedures are clearly documented for all major application components.
- [ ] Automated tools or scripts are available to execute rollbacks.
- [ ] Rollbacks can be performed quickly and efficiently to minimize downtime.
- [ ] The rollback process ensures data integrity and consistency.
- [ ] Rollback success or failure is clearly reported.
- [ ] The rollback mechanism is regularly tested to ensure its reliability.

## Technical Requirements

- Define a strategy for versioning and storing deployable artifacts.
- Implement rollback scripts or use platform-native rollback features (e.g., Kubernetes rollbacks, cloud provider snapshots).
- Document the steps for manual and automated rollbacks.
- Integrate rollback capabilities into the CI/CD pipeline or a separate operations dashboard.
- Ensure database schema rollbacks are handled carefully to prevent data loss.

## Dependencies

- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).
- Release management and versioning (Story 10.10).
- Database backup and restore procedures.

## Priority

Critical - Minimizes impact of deployment failures and ensures business continuity.
