Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want clear and automated environment promotion strategies so that application changes move consistently and reliably through development, staging, and production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Defined promotion paths exist for code and configuration from development to staging to production.
- [ ] Automated gates (e.g., all tests pass, security scans clean) are enforced before promotion to the next environment.
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations are managed and applied automatically during promotion.
- [ ] The promotion process is auditable, showing who promoted what and when.
- [ ] Manual approval steps are integrated where necessary (e.g., before production deployment).
- [ ] The promotion process ensures that only validated changes reach higher environments.

## Technical Requirements

- Define environment variables or configuration files for each environment.
- Implement scripts or CI/CD pipeline steps to apply environment-specific configurations.
- Configure automated quality gates within the CI/CD pipeline for each promotion step.
- Integrate with an approval system for manual gates.
- Document the environment promotion workflow.

## Dependencies

- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).
- Continuous Deployment with Quality Gates (Story 10.3).
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation (Story 10.8).

## Priority

High - Ensures controlled and reliable release management.
