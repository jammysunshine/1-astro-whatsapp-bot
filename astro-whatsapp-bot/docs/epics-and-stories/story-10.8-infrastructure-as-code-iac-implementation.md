# Story 10.8: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Implementation

Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want all infrastructure to be defined and managed as code so that environment provisioning is automated, consistent, and version-controlled.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All cloud infrastructure (e.g., VMs, databases, networks, load balancers) is defined using IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
- [ ] Infrastructure changes are applied through automated pipelines.
- [ ] Infrastructure configurations are version-controlled.
- [ ] Environments can be provisioned and de-provisioned consistently and on-demand.
- [ ] The IaC setup supports multiple environments (dev, staging, production).
- [ ] The infrastructure state is auditable and drift detection is implemented.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure an IaC tool (e.g., Terraform).
- Write IaC templates for all required infrastructure components.
- Integrate IaC deployment into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Implement state management for IaC configurations.
- Ensure secure handling of IaC credentials and access.

## Dependencies

- Cloud provider accounts.
- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).
- Version control system.

## Priority

Critical - Ensures consistent, scalable, and auditable infrastructure.
