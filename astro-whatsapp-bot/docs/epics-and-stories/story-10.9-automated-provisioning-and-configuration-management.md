Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want automated provisioning and configuration management for application servers and services so that environments are consistently set up and maintained without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated tools provision and configure application servers and services.
- [ ] Configuration drift is detected and remediated automatically.
- [ ] Configuration changes are version-controlled and auditable.
- [ ] The system supports different configurations for various environments (dev, staging, production).
- [ ] Automated provisioning integrates with IaC for a complete infrastructure setup.
- [ ] The process ensures that all dependencies and prerequisites for the application are met.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet).
- Develop playbooks or recipes for configuring application servers and installing dependencies.
- Integrate configuration management into the CI/CD pipeline or IaC deployment.
- Implement secret management for sensitive configuration data.
- Ensure idempotency of configuration scripts.

## Dependencies

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation (Story 10.8).
- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).
- Secret management solution.

## Priority

High - Ensures consistent and reliable environment setup.
