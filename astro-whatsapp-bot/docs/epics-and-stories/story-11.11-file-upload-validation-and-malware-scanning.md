# Story 11.11: File Upload Validation and Malware Scanning

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security engineer, I want all file uploads to be validated and scanned for malware so that the application is protected against malicious file uploads and ensures data integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All uploaded files are validated for type, size, and content.
- [ ] Files are scanned for malware and viruses before being stored or processed.
- [ ] Only allowed file types are accepted.
- [ ] Files exceeding size limits are rejected.
- [ ] Malicious files are quarantined or rejected, and alerts are triggered.
- [ ] The file upload process is secure and prevents directory traversal or other file-related attacks.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement file type validation (e.g., magic bytes, file extensions).
- Enforce file size limits.
- Integrate with a malware scanning service or library (e.g., ClamAV, cloud-based scanning).
- Store uploaded files securely, preferably outside the web root.
- Implement robust error handling for failed uploads and scans.

## Dependencies
- File storage system (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).

## Priority
High - Protects against malicious content and system compromise.
