# Story 11.3: Input Validation and Sanitization

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a developer, I want robust input validation and sanitization implemented for all user inputs so that the application is protected against common injection attacks and data corruption.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All user-provided inputs are validated against expected formats and constraints.
- [ ] Inputs are sanitized to remove or neutralize malicious content (e.g., HTML, SQL injection).
- [ ] Validation and sanitization are applied at the earliest possible point in the application flow.
- [ ] Error messages for invalid inputs are user-friendly and do not expose internal details.
- [ ] A centralized and reusable input validation mechanism is implemented.
- [ ] The application is resilient to common injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection).

## Technical Requirements
- Implement a comprehensive input validation library or framework.
- Define validation rules for all input fields based on data types and business logic.
- Use context-aware sanitization techniques (e.g., HTML escaping for display, SQL parameterization for database queries).
- Integrate validation into API endpoints and user interfaces.
- Conduct security testing to verify protection against injection attacks.

## Dependencies
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).
- API endpoints and user interfaces.

## Priority
Critical - Prevents common web vulnerabilities and data corruption.
