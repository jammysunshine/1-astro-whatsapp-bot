# Story 11.4: Authentication and Authorization Implementation

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security architect, I want robust authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented so that only legitimate and authorized users can access application resources and perform actions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can securely authenticate to the application using defined methods (e.g., WhatsApp number verification, JWT).
- [ ] Authorization rules are enforced to control access to resources and functionalities based on user roles.
- [ ] Session management is secure, preventing session hijacking and fixation attacks.
- [ ] Authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) are securely generated, stored, and validated.
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are logged and monitored.
- [ ] The system prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement a secure authentication flow (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT-based).
- Define user roles and permissions for authorization.
- Implement middleware or decorators to enforce authorization checks on API endpoints.
- Securely store and manage user credentials (e.g., hashed passwords).
- Implement secure session management (e.g., HTTP-only cookies, token refresh mechanisms).

## Dependencies
- User authentication and profile system (Epic 1).
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).

## Priority
Critical - Controls access to the application and protects user data.
