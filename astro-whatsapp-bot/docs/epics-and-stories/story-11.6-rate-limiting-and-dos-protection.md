# Story 11.6: Rate Limiting and DoS Protection

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security engineer, I want rate limiting and Denial-of-Service (DoS) protection implemented for all public-facing endpoints so that the application is resilient to abuse and malicious attacks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All public-facing API endpoints have rate limiting applied.
- [ ] The application is protected against common DoS and brute-force attacks.
- [ ] Rate limits are configurable and can be adjusted based on traffic patterns.
- [ ] Users exceeding rate limits receive appropriate error responses.
- [ ] The system logs and alerts on suspicious traffic patterns indicative of DoS attacks.
- [ ] Critical endpoints (e.g., login, registration) have stricter rate limits.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement a rate-limiting middleware or service (e.g., using Redis, Nginx, or cloud provider services).
- Define rate-limiting policies per endpoint or per user/IP address.
- Configure web application firewalls (WAF) or cloud-based DoS protection services.
- Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems for traffic anomalies.
- Document rate-limiting policies and DoS protection mechanisms.

## Dependencies
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).
- Public-facing API endpoints.
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).

## Priority
Critical - Protects application availability and prevents abuse.
