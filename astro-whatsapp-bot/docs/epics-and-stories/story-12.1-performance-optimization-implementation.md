Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a developer, I want to implement general performance optimization techniques across the application so that the system is fast, responsive, and provides an optimal user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core application functionalities demonstrate measurable performance improvements.
- [ ] Application startup time is optimized.
- [ ] Key user interactions are highly responsive.
- [ ] Unnecessary computations or resource-intensive operations are minimized.
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified through profiling are addressed.
- [ ] The application consistently meets defined performance targets.

## Technical Requirements
- Conduct an initial performance audit to identify areas for improvement.
- Apply general code optimization techniques (e.g., efficient algorithms, reduced I/O operations).
- Optimize application startup and initialization processes.
- Refactor inefficient code paths identified by profiling tools.
- Implement best practices for resource management and cleanup.

## Dependencies
- Core application codebase.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).
- Code profiling and bottleneck identification (Story 12.6).

## Priority
Critical - Ensures a fast and responsive user experience.
