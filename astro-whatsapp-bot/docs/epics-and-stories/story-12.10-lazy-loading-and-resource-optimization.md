# Story 12.10: Lazy Loading and Resource Optimization

Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a frontend developer, I want lazy loading implemented for non-critical resources and other resource optimization techniques applied so that initial page load times are minimized and application responsiveness is improved.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Non-critical assets (e.g., images, videos, JavaScript modules, components) are lazy-loaded.
- [ ] Initial page load times are measurably reduced.
- [ ] Resources are optimized (e.g., image compression, code splitting, minification) to reduce their size.
- [ ] The application remains responsive during the loading of lazy-loaded content.
- [ ] Core Web Vitals (e.g., LCP, FID, CLS) are improved.
- [ ] Resource optimization techniques are applied consistently across the application.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement lazy loading for images and videos using native browser features or JavaScript libraries.
- Configure code splitting for JavaScript bundles to load modules on demand.
- Optimize image assets (compression, responsive images, WebP format).
- Minify and bundle CSS and JavaScript files.
- Implement tree-shaking to remove unused code.
- Prioritize critical CSS and JavaScript for initial render.

## Dependencies
- Frontend application codebase.
- Build tools (e.g., Webpack, Rollup).
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority
High - Improves perceived performance and user experience.
