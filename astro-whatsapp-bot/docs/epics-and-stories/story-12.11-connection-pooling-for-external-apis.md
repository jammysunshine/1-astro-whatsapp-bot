# Story 12.11: Connection Pooling for External APIs

## Epic

Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story

As a developer, I want connection pooling implemented for external API calls so that the overhead of establishing new connections is reduced, improving performance and resource utilization when interacting with third-party services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] HTTP connections to frequently called external APIs utilize a connection pool.
- [ ] The overhead of establishing new TCP connections for API calls is minimized.
- [ ] Resource utilization (e.g., socket usage) for external API interactions is optimized.
- [ ] The application demonstrates improved performance for operations involving external API calls.
- [ ] Connection pool metrics (e.g., active connections, wait times) for external APIs are monitored.
- [ ] The application maintains stable performance under varying load conditions related to external API connections.

## Technical Requirements

- Configure HTTP clients (e.g., `axios`, `node-fetch` with `agentkeepalive`) to use connection pooling.
- Identify frequently called external APIs suitable for connection pooling.
- Define optimal pool sizes and connection timeout settings for external API clients.
- Ensure proper connection release and error handling within the pool.
- Monitor external API connection pool performance and adjust configurations as needed.

## Dependencies

- External API integrations.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority

Medium - Improves efficiency and performance of external API interactions.
