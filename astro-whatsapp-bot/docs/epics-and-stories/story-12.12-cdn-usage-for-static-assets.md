Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to be used for serving static assets so that content is delivered faster to users globally, reducing latency and improving application load times.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript, fonts) are served via a CDN.
- [ ] Content is cached at edge locations closer to users.
- [ ] Latency for static asset delivery is significantly reduced.
- [ ] The application demonstrates improved load times, especially for geographically dispersed users.
- [ ] CDN cache hit ratios are optimized.
- [ ] The CDN configuration is secure and reliable.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure a CDN provider (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN).
- Integrate the CDN with the application's asset pipeline.
- Configure cache control headers for optimal caching behavior.
- Ensure proper invalidation strategies for updated assets.
- Update application code to reference CDN URLs for static assets.
- Monitor CDN performance and usage metrics.

## Dependencies

- Static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript).
- Frontend application codebase.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority

High - Improves global performance and reduces server load.
