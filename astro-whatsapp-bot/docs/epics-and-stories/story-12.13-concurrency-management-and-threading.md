# Story 12.13: Concurrency Management and Threading

## Epic
Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a developer, I want appropriate concurrency models (e.g., async/await, threading, multiprocessing) implemented to handle multiple requests efficiently so that the application can scale to high user loads and maintain responsiveness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The application effectively handles multiple concurrent user requests.
- [ ] Blocking I/O operations are managed asynchronously to prevent performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] CPU-bound tasks are executed efficiently without blocking the main event loop.
- [ ] The application demonstrates improved throughput and responsiveness under load.
- [ ] Concurrency-related issues (e.g., race conditions, deadlocks) are prevented.
- [ ] Resource utilization under concurrent load is optimized.

## Technical Requirements
- Identify sections of the application that can benefit from concurrency.
- Implement asynchronous programming patterns (e.g., `async/await` in Node.js/Python, goroutines in Go, threads in Java).
- Utilize worker threads or multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.
- Implement proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes) to prevent race conditions.
- Conduct load testing to validate concurrency implementation.

## Dependencies
- Core application codebase.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).
- Load and stress testing (Epic 9, Story 9.14).

## Priority
High - Essential for scalable and responsive applications.
