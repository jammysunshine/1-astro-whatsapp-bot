Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story

As a system administrator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and metrics collection so that I can track application health, identify performance issues in real-time, and make data-driven optimization decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Key application performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory, network I/O, response times, error rates) are collected.
- [ ] Metrics are visualized in real-time dashboards.
- [ ] Alerts are configured to notify operations teams of performance anomalies.
- [ ] Historical performance data is retained for trend analysis and capacity planning.
- [ ] Monitoring covers all layers of the application stack (e.g., infrastructure, application, database).
- [ ] The monitoring system is integrated with the CI/CD pipeline to track performance changes across deployments.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic).
- Instrument application code to emit custom metrics.
- Configure infrastructure monitoring agents.
- Set up dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Define alerting rules with appropriate thresholds and notification channels.
- Integrate monitoring data with logging and tracing systems for comprehensive observability.

## Dependencies

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation (Epic 10, Story 10.8).
- Automated health checks (Epic 10, Story 10.14).
- Logging infrastructure (Epic 14).

## Priority

Critical - Essential for maintaining application health and performance.
