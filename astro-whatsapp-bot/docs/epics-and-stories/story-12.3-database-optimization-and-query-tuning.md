Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story

As a database administrator, I want database optimization and query tuning performed so that data retrieval is fast and efficient, reducing latency and improving overall application performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All critical database queries are optimized for performance.
- [ ] Appropriate indexes are created for frequently queried columns.
- [ ] Database schema is reviewed and optimized for efficiency.
- [ ] Query execution times for critical operations are reduced to meet performance targets.
- [ ] Database load and resource utilization are within acceptable limits.
- [ ] Regular query performance monitoring is in place.

## Technical Requirements

- Analyze slow queries using database performance monitoring tools.
- Create or optimize indexes based on query patterns.
- Refactor inefficient SQL queries or ORM usage.
- Denormalize tables or use materialized views where appropriate.
- Configure database parameters for optimal performance.
- Implement a process for continuous database performance tuning.

## Dependencies

- Database system (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).
- Database schema and query analysis tools.

## Priority

Critical - Essential for data-intensive applications.
