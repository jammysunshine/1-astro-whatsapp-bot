Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story

As a developer, I want time-consuming operations to be processed asynchronously using message queues so that user-facing requests remain responsive and system throughput is improved.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Long-running tasks (e.g., complex astrology calculations, report generation, bulk notifications) are offloaded to a message queue.
- [ ] User-facing requests return quickly without waiting for asynchronous tasks to complete.
- [ ] Message queue ensures reliable delivery and processing of tasks.
- [ ] System throughput for background tasks is improved.
- [ ] The application remains responsive even during high load periods for background processing.
- [ ] Asynchronous task status and progress are trackable.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and integrate a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS, Redis Queue).
- Identify long-running or non-critical tasks suitable for asynchronous processing.
- Implement producers to send messages to the queue and consumers to process them.
- Design robust error handling and retry mechanisms for asynchronous tasks.
- Monitor queue depth, message processing rates, and worker health.

## Dependencies

- Message queue infrastructure.
- Long-running application tasks.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority

High - Improves responsiveness and scalability for heavy workloads.
