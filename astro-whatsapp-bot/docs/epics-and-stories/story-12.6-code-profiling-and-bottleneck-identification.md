Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story

As a developer, I want to use code profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks so that I can pinpoint inefficient code sections and optimize them for better application performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Code profiling tools are integrated into the development and testing workflow.
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks (e.g., CPU-intensive operations, excessive memory usage, slow I/O) are accurately identified.
- [ ] Profiling reports provide actionable insights into code optimization opportunities.
- [ ] Developers can easily run and interpret profiling results.
- [ ] The profiling process helps in reducing execution times for critical functions.
- [ ] Regular profiling is conducted for performance-critical sections of the application.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure appropriate profiling tools for the chosen tech stack (e.g., Node.js Inspector, Python cProfile, Java VisualVM).
- Integrate profiling into local development environments and CI/CD pipelines.
- Establish a process for analyzing profiling data and prioritizing optimizations.
- Train developers on how to effectively use profiling tools.
- Document common performance anti-patterns to avoid.

## Dependencies

- Core application codebase.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority

Medium - Essential for targeted performance improvements.
