Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story
As a system architect, I want graceful degradation implemented so that the application can continue to operate with reduced functionality when critical services are unavailable, maintaining a basic level of service for users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The application identifies critical and non-critical functionalities.
- [ ] When a non-critical service fails, the application continues to function without it.
- [ ] Users are informed when certain functionalities are unavailable or degraded.
- [ ] The application prioritizes core functionalities during degraded states.
- [ ] The system can recover gracefully when the failed service becomes available again.
- [ ] The impact of degraded functionality on user experience is minimized.

## Technical Requirements
- Design the application with clear separation of critical and non-critical components.
- Implement feature toggles or configuration flags to disable non-critical features dynamically.
- Develop alternative code paths or default responses for unavailable services.
- Integrate with monitoring and alerting to detect service failures and trigger degradation.
- Provide user-facing messages or UI elements to indicate degraded functionality.

## Dependencies
- System architecture and component design.
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).
- Error handling mechanisms.

## Priority
Critical - Ensures continuous service availability even during partial failures.
