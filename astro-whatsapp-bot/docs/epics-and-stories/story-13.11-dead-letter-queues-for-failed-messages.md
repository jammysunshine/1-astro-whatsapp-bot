# Story 13.11: Dead Letter Queues for Failed Messages

## Epic

Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a developer, I want dead letter queues (DLQs) implemented for failed messages in asynchronous processing systems so that messages that cannot be processed successfully are isolated for analysis and reprocessing, preventing data loss.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is configured for all critical message queues.
- [ ] Messages that fail processing after a defined number of retries are automatically moved to the DLQ.
- [ ] Messages in the DLQ can be easily inspected for root cause analysis.
- [ ] A mechanism exists to reprocess messages from the DLQ after issues are resolved.
- [ ] Alerts are triggered when messages accumulate in the DLQ.
- [ ] The system prevents data loss for messages that encounter persistent processing failures.

## Technical Requirements

- Configure DLQs for message queue systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS).
- Implement logic in message consumers to move failed messages to the DLQ after retry limits are exhausted.
- Develop tools or scripts for browsing and re-queuing messages from the DLQ.
- Integrate DLQ monitoring with the alerting system.
- Document the DLQ strategy and message reprocessing procedures.

## Dependencies

- Asynchronous processing and queuing (Epic 12, Story 12.5).
- Message queue infrastructure.
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).

## Priority

High - Prevents data loss and aids in debugging persistent message processing failures.
