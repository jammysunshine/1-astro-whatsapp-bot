Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story
As a developer, I want the circuit breaker pattern to have well-defined states and transitions so that its behavior is predictable, and I can effectively monitor and manage its impact on application resilience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The circuit breaker correctly implements the Closed, Open, and Half-Open states.
- [ ] Transitions between states occur based on predefined failure thresholds and timeouts.
- [ ] The circuit breaker automatically transitions from Open to Half-Open after a configured timeout.
- [ ] A limited number of test requests are allowed in the Half-Open state to check service recovery.
- [ ] Successful test requests in Half-Open state transition the circuit to Closed.
- [ ] Failure of test requests in Half-Open state transition the circuit back to Open.
- [ ] All state changes and transitions are logged and monitored.

## Technical Requirements
- Utilize a circuit breaker library that supports standard state machine (Closed, Open, Half-Open).
- Configure failure thresholds (e.g., number of failures, error rate percentage).
- Define the `waitDurationInOpenState` (timeout before transitioning to Half-Open).
- Implement `permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState` for test requests.
- Integrate circuit breaker state changes with logging and monitoring systems.

## Dependencies
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation (Story 13.2).
- Comprehensive error logging and context (Story 13.5).
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).

## Priority
High - Ensures predictable and effective resilience behavior.
