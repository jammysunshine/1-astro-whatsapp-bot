Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want graceful shutdown procedures implemented for all application services so that ongoing requests are completed, resources are properly released, and data integrity is maintained during restarts or deployments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Application services can receive and respond to shutdown signals (e.g., SIGTERM).
- [ ] Upon receiving a shutdown signal, services stop accepting new requests.
- [ ] Ongoing requests are allowed to complete within a configurable timeout period.
- [ ] All open connections (e.g., database, message queue) are gracefully closed.
- [ ] Resources (e.g., file handles, timers) are properly released.
- [ ] The shutdown process ensures data integrity and prevents data loss.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement signal handlers in application code to catch shutdown signals.
- Configure web servers or application frameworks to stop accepting new connections.
- Implement logic to wait for active requests to complete.
- Ensure proper cleanup of all allocated resources.
- Integrate graceful shutdown into deployment processes (e.g., Kubernetes preStop hooks).
- Log the shutdown process for auditing and troubleshooting.

## Dependencies

- Automated deployment pipeline (Epic 10).
- Resource cleanup on error conditions (Story 13.14).

## Priority

High - Ensures data integrity and minimizes service disruption during restarts.
