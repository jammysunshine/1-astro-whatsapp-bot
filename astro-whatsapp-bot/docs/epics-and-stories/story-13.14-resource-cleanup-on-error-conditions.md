Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a developer, I want proper resource cleanup on error conditions so that allocated resources (e.g., file handles, database connections, network sockets) are always released, preventing leaks and ensuring system stability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All allocated resources are released when an error occurs in a code path.
- [ ] File handles are closed, database connections are returned to the pool, and network sockets are terminated.
- [ ] Resource leaks are prevented, ensuring stable application performance over time.
- [ ] The application does not accumulate open resources during error scenarios.
- [ ] Code reviews specifically check for proper resource cleanup in error handling blocks.
- [ ] Tools for detecting resource leaks are integrated into the development workflow.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement `try-finally` blocks or equivalent resource management constructs (e.g., `using` statements, `with` statements) for all resource-intensive operations.
- Ensure database transactions are properly committed or rolled back.
- Develop a consistent pattern for error handling that includes resource cleanup.
- Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential resource leaks.
- Document best practices for resource management in error conditions.

## Dependencies

- Comprehensive error logging and context (Story 13.5).
- Memory management and garbage collection (Epic 12, Story 12.7).

## Priority

High - Prevents resource exhaustion and improves system stability.
