Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a UX designer, I want user-friendly error messages that provide clear, actionable guidance without exposing sensitive system details so that users can understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All user-facing error messages are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- [ ] Error messages provide actionable advice on how to resolve the issue or what steps to take next.
- [ ] Sensitive system details (e.g., stack traces, internal error codes) are never exposed to end-users.
- [ ] Error messages are consistent in tone and style across the application.
- [ ] The application distinguishes between different types of errors and provides tailored messages.
- [ ] User feedback mechanisms are in place for reporting unclear or unhelpful error messages.

## Technical Requirements

- Map internal error codes or exceptions to external, user-friendly messages.
- Implement a mechanism to prevent sensitive information from being displayed in error messages.
- Provide guidelines for writing effective error messages to developers.
- Integrate with the localization system for multi-language error messages.

## Dependencies
