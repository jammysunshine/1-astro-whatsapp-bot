Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a developer, I want the circuit breaker pattern implemented for external service calls so that the application can prevent cascading failures and gracefully handle temporary outages of dependent services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Circuit breakers are implemented for all calls to external services.
- [ ] The circuit breaker monitors call failures and trips when a threshold is reached.
- [ ] Once tripped, the circuit breaker prevents further calls to the failing service for a defined period.
- [ ] The circuit breaker allows a limited number of test calls to determine if the service has recovered.
- [ ] The application provides a fallback mechanism when the circuit is open.
- [ ] Circuit breaker states (closed, open, half-open) are monitored and logged.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and integrate a circuit breaker library or framework (e.g., Polly, Hystrix, resilience4j).
- Identify all external service calls that require circuit breakers.
- Configure failure thresholds, reset timeouts, and test call intervals.
- Implement fallback logic for when the circuit is open.
- Integrate circuit breaker state monitoring with the observability infrastructure.

## Dependencies

- External service integrations.
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).
- Graceful degradation implementation (Story 13.1).

## Priority

Critical - Prevents cascading failures and improves system stability.
