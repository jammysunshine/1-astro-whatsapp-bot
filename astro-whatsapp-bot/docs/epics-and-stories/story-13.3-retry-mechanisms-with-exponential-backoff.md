Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a developer, I want intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff implemented for transient failures in external service calls so that the application can recover from temporary issues without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Retry logic is applied to operations prone to transient failures (e.g., network issues, temporary service unavailability).
- [ ] Retries are performed with an exponential backoff strategy to avoid overwhelming the failing service.
- [ ] A maximum number of retries is defined to prevent indefinite waiting.
- [ ] Jitter is added to backoff intervals to prevent synchronized retry storms.
- [ ] Operations eventually fail and trigger appropriate error handling if retries are exhausted.
- [ ] Retry attempts and outcomes are logged for debugging and analysis.

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate a retry library or implement custom retry logic.
- Identify operations that can benefit from retry mechanisms.
- Configure initial delay, exponential backoff factor, and maximum retry attempts.
- Implement jitter to randomize retry intervals.
- Ensure retries are only applied to idempotent operations or those with appropriate safeguards.

## Dependencies

- External service integrations.
- Comprehensive error logging and context (Story 13.5).

## Priority

High - Improves application robustness against transient failures.
