Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a system architect, I want fallback mechanisms and alternative paths implemented for critical functionalities so that the application can provide a degraded but still functional experience when primary services are unavailable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fallback logic is defined for critical external service dependencies.
- [ ] The application can switch to an alternative path or provide a default response when a primary service fails.
- [ ] Users are informed when a fallback mechanism is active.
- [ ] The fallback mechanism ensures that core functionalities remain accessible.
- [ ] The system can seamlessly switch back to the primary service once it recovers.
- [ ] Fallback activations and deactivations are logged and monitored.

## Technical Requirements

- Identify critical external dependencies and define their fallback behaviors.
- Implement alternative data sources or simplified logic for fallback scenarios.
- Design user interfaces to clearly communicate when fallback modes are active.
- Integrate fallback mechanisms with circuit breakers or retry logic.
- Develop monitoring and alerting for fallback activations.

## Dependencies

- External service integrations.
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation (Story 13.2).
- Graceful degradation implementation (Story 13.1).

## Priority

High - Ensures core functionality remains available during outages.
