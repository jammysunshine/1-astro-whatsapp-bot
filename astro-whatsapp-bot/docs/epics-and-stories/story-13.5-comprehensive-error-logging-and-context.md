Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging with rich context so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues, reducing debugging time and improving system stability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All application errors are logged with relevant context (e.g., stack traces, request IDs, user IDs, input values).
- [ ] Log messages are structured and machine-readable.
- [ ] Sensitive information is redacted from logs to ensure privacy.
- [ ] Error logs are centralized and easily searchable.
- [ ] The logging system provides sufficient detail for root cause analysis.
- [ ] Error rates and types are monitored and alerted upon.

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate a structured logging library (e.g., Winston, Serilog, Log4j).
- Implement a global error handler to catch unhandled exceptions.
- Enrich log entries with contextual information (e.g., correlation IDs, user session data).
- Configure log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL).
- Implement log redaction for sensitive data.
- Integrate with a centralized logging solution (Epic 14).

## Dependencies

- Logging and monitoring infrastructure (Epic 14).
- Error handling mechanisms.

## Priority

Critical - Essential for debugging and incident response.
