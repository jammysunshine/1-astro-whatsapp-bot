Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a developer, I want proper timeout management for all external requests so that the application does not hang indefinitely waiting for unresponsive services, preventing resource exhaustion and improving overall system stability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All external API calls and database operations have defined timeouts.
- [ ] The application gracefully handles timeout exceptions.
- [ ] Timeouts are configured to prevent long-running requests from blocking resources.
- [ ] Users receive timely feedback when an external service is unresponsive.
- [ ] Timeout values are configurable and can be adjusted without code changes.
- [ ] Monitoring tracks timeout occurrences and helps identify problematic dependencies.

## Technical Requirements

- Configure timeouts for HTTP clients used for external API calls.
- Set timeouts for database queries and connection attempts.
- Implement a global timeout policy or apply timeouts per critical operation.
- Integrate timeout handling with retry mechanisms and circuit breakers.
- Log timeout events with sufficient context for debugging.

## Dependencies

- External service integrations.
- Database system.
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff (Story 13.3).
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation (Story 13.2).

## Priority

High - Prevents resource exhaustion and improves application responsiveness.
