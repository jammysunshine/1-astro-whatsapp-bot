Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a system administrator, I want comprehensive health check endpoints implemented for all services so that I can monitor the operational status of the application and its dependencies in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each microservice or critical component exposes a `/health` or `/status` endpoint.
- [ ] Health checks verify the status of internal components (e.g., database connection, message queue connectivity).
- [ ] Health checks can optionally verify the reachability of external dependencies.
- [ ] The health check response provides clear status indicators (e.g., UP/DOWN, detailed component status).
- [ ] Health check endpoints are secured to prevent unauthorized access.
- [ ] Monitoring systems can consume these endpoints to determine service availability.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement a standardized health check interface for all services.
- Develop logic within health check endpoints to verify critical internal and external dependencies.
- Ensure health check endpoints are lightweight and performant.
- Secure health check endpoints (e.g., API key, IP whitelisting).
- Document the health check endpoints and their expected responses.

## Dependencies

- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).
- Database system.
- External service integrations.

## Priority

Critical - Essential for operational visibility and automated recovery.
