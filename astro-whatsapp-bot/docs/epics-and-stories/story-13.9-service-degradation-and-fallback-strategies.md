Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story

As a system architect, I want clear service degradation and fallback strategies defined and implemented so that the application can maintain core functionality and user experience even when non-critical dependencies fail.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Strategies are defined for how the application behaves when non-critical services are unavailable.
- [ ] The application can automatically switch to a fallback mode or provide default content.
- [ ] Users are clearly informed about any degraded functionality.
- [ ] The system prioritizes critical user journeys during degraded states.
- [ ] The application can seamlessly restore full functionality once the dependency recovers.
- [ ] Degradation and fallback events are logged and monitored.

## Technical Requirements

- Identify non-critical services and their impact on user experience.
- Implement feature flags or configuration to enable/disable non-critical features.
- Develop default responses or cached data for non-critical service failures.
- Integrate with circuit breakers and retry mechanisms to manage service health.
- Design user interfaces to gracefully handle missing data or functionality.

## Dependencies

- Graceful degradation implementation (Story 13.1).
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation (Story 13.2).
- Fallback mechanisms and alternative paths (Story 13.4).

## Priority

High - Ensures a resilient user experience during partial outages.
