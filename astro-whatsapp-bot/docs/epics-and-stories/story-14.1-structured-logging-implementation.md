Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story

As a developer, I want structured logging implemented across the application so that log messages are machine-readable, easily parsable, and provide consistent context for debugging and analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All application logs are emitted in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
- [ ] Log messages include consistent fields such as timestamp, log level, service name, and message.
- [ ] Contextual information (e.g., request ID, user ID) is automatically added to log entries.
- [ ] Log messages are easily parsable by log aggregation tools.
- [ ] The logging framework is configured to prevent sensitive data from being logged.
- [ ] Structured logs improve the efficiency of debugging and troubleshooting.

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate a structured logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino for Node.js; Logback, Serilog for others).
- Define a standardized schema for log entries.
- Implement middleware or interceptors to enrich log entries with request-specific context.
- Configure log formatters to output JSON or other structured formats.
- Establish guidelines for developers on what and how to log.

## Dependencies

- Core application codebase.
- Comprehensive error logging and context (Epic 13, Story 13.5).

## Priority

Critical - Foundation for effective observability and troubleshooting.
