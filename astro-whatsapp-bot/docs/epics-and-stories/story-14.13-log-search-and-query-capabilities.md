# Story 14.13: Log Search and Query Capabilities

## Epic

Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story

As a developer, I want powerful log search and query capabilities within the centralized logging solution so that I can efficiently find specific log events, filter by various criteria, and analyze log patterns to diagnose issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can search logs using free-text queries.
- [ ] Logs can be filtered by multiple criteria (e.g., log level, service name, timestamp range, specific fields).
- [ ] The search interface provides advanced query language features (e.g., boolean operators, regular expressions).
- [ ] Search results are returned quickly and efficiently.
- [ ] Users can save frequently used queries.
- [ ] The system supports correlating log entries across different services for a single request.

## Technical Requirements

- Configure the centralized logging solution (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk) for optimal search performance.
- Ensure proper indexing of structured log fields.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for constructing and executing queries.
- Implement mechanisms for correlating log entries using trace IDs or request IDs.
- Document the available search syntax and common query patterns.

## Dependencies

- Centralized logging solution (Story 14.2).
- Structured logging implementation (Story 14.1).
- Distributed tracing implementation (Story 14.9).

## Priority

High - Essential for efficient troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
