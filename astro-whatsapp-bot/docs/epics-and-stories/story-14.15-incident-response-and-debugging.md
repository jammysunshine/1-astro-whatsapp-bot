Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story

As a system administrator, I want integrated tools and processes for incident response and debugging so that I can quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve production issues, minimizing their impact on users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A clear incident response process is defined and documented.
- [ ] Tools for real-time debugging and diagnostics are integrated.
- [ ] The observability stack provides a unified view for incident investigation (logs, metrics, traces).
- [ ] Runbooks or playbooks are available for common incident types.
- [ ] Post-incident reviews (PIRs) are conducted to identify root causes and prevent recurrence.
- [ ] The system supports collaboration among incident responders.

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate incident management platforms (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie) with alerting systems.
- Provide access to debugging tools (e.g., remote debuggers, shell access to containers).
- Ensure correlation of logs, metrics, and traces for a holistic view of incidents.
- Develop automated runbooks for common incident scenarios.
- Implement a knowledge base for incident history and resolutions.

## Dependencies

- Alerting systems and notification (Story 14.7).
- Log search and query capabilities (Story 14.13).
- Distributed tracing implementation (Story 14.9).
- Dashboard and visualization (Story 14.14).

## Priority

Critical - Essential for rapid resolution of production issues.
