Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story

As a system administrator, I want a centralized logging solution implemented so that all application and infrastructure logs are collected in one place, enabling efficient search, analysis, and long-term retention.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All application, server, and infrastructure logs are forwarded to a centralized logging system.
- [ ] Logs are indexed and searchable by various criteria (e.g., timestamp, log level, service name, message content).
- [ ] The centralized solution provides a user interface for log exploration and analysis.
- [ ] Log data is retained for a defined period for auditing and historical analysis.
- [ ] The solution is scalable to handle high volumes of log data.
- [ ] Access to the centralized logging solution is secured and controlled.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure a centralized logging platform (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, Datadog, cloud-native solutions).
- Implement log shippers (e.g., Filebeat, Fluentd, Logstash) on application servers.
- Configure log parsing rules to extract relevant fields from structured and unstructured logs.
- Set up retention policies for log data.
- Integrate with IAM for access control to the logging platform.

## Dependencies

- Structured logging implementation (Story 14.1).
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation (Epic 10, Story 10.8).

## Priority

Critical - Essential for operational visibility and troubleshooting.
