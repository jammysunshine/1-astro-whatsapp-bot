# Story 14.3: Log Level Configuration and Management

## Epic

Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story

As a developer, I want flexible log level configuration and management so that I can dynamically adjust the verbosity of logs in different environments, enabling detailed debugging in development and concise monitoring in production.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) are configurable at runtime without application redeployment.
- [ ] Different log levels can be applied to specific modules or components.
- [ ] The application emits logs at the configured level, filtering out less severe messages.
- [ ] Changes to log levels are reflected immediately.
- [ ] The configuration mechanism is secure and prevents unauthorized changes.
- [ ] The system provides clear documentation on how to manage log levels.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement a logging framework that supports dynamic log level configuration.
- Expose a secure API endpoint or configuration mechanism for runtime log level changes.
- Ensure log levels can be set globally or granularly per logger/module.
- Integrate log level management with environment variables or a configuration service.
- Document the impact of different log levels on performance and storage.

## Dependencies

- Structured logging implementation (Story 14.1).
- Centralized logging solution (Story 14.2).

## Priority

High - Improves debugging efficiency and reduces log noise in production.
