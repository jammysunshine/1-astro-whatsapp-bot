# Story 14.4: Log Aggregation and Analysis

## Epic
Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want robust log aggregation and analysis capabilities so that I can quickly identify patterns, anomalies, and root causes of issues across distributed systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Logs from all services and infrastructure components are aggregated into a central system.
- [ ] The aggregation system can parse and index structured log data.
- [ ] Users can perform complex queries and filters on aggregated logs.
- [ ] The system can identify common log patterns and anomalies.
- [ ] Dashboards and visualizations can be created from log data.
- [ ] Alerts can be configured based on specific log events or patterns.

## Technical Requirements
- Configure log shippers and processors to collect logs from various sources.
- Utilize a log aggregation tool (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk) for indexing and searching.
- Develop parsing rules for different log formats.
- Implement correlation mechanisms (e.g., trace IDs) to link logs across services.
- Configure dashboards and alerts based on critical log events.

## Dependencies
- Centralized logging solution (Story 14.2).
- Structured logging implementation (Story 14.1).
- Alerting systems and notification (Story 14.7).

## Priority
Critical - Essential for understanding system behavior and troubleshooting.
