# Story 14.5: Metrics Collection and Monitoring

## Epic

Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story

As a system administrator, I want comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring so that I can track the health, performance, and resource utilization of the application and its infrastructure in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Key system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic) are collected from all infrastructure components.
- [ ] Application-specific metrics (e.g., request rates, error rates, latency, queue depths) are collected.
- [ ] Metrics are stored in a time-series database.
- [ ] Real-time dashboards visualize key performance indicators (KPIs).
- [ ] Alerts are triggered based on predefined thresholds for critical metrics.
- [ ] Historical metrics data is available for trend analysis and capacity planning.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure a metrics collection system (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB).
- Implement agents or exporters to collect system-level metrics.
- Instrument application code to emit custom business and performance metrics.
- Configure a time-series database for metrics storage.
- Integrate with a dashboarding tool (e.g., Grafana) for visualization.

## Dependencies

- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Epic 12, Story 12.15).
- Alerting systems and notification (Story 14.7).

## Priority

Critical - Essential for understanding system health and performance.
