Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story

As a system administrator, I want robust alerting systems with flexible notification channels so that I am immediately informed of critical issues, performance degradations, or security incidents, enabling rapid response.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Alerts are triggered based on predefined thresholds for metrics, logs, and APM data.
- [ ] Notifications are sent to appropriate channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, email, SMS).
- [ ] Alert messages are clear, actionable, and include relevant context for diagnosis.
- [ ] Alerting rules are configurable and can be managed centrally.
- [ ] The system supports different severity levels for alerts with corresponding escalation policies.
- [ ] False positives are minimized, and alerts are reliable.

## Technical Requirements

- Configure an alerting engine (e.g., Alertmanager for Prometheus, cloud-native alerting services).
- Define alerting rules based on metrics (Story 14.5), logs (Story 14.4), and APM data (Story 14.6).
- Integrate with various notification services.
- Implement on-call schedules and escalation policies.
- Document alerting rules, thresholds, and response procedures.

## Dependencies

- Metrics collection and monitoring (Story 14.5).
- Log aggregation and analysis (Story 14.4).
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) (Story 14.6).

## Priority

Critical - Essential for rapid incident response and system reliability.
