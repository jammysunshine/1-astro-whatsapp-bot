Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story

As a system administrator, I want health check endpoints to be integrated with the observability infrastructure so that their status can be continuously monitored, visualized, and used to trigger alerts or automated recovery actions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Health check endpoints (as defined in Epic 13, Story 13.8) are continuously monitored by the observability system.
- [ ] The status of health checks is visualized in real-time dashboards.
- [ ] Alerts are triggered when health checks indicate service degradation or failure.
- [ ] Health check failures can automatically trigger recovery actions (e.g., service restarts, scaling adjustments).
- [ ] Historical health check data is available for trend analysis.
- [ ] The integration provides a unified view of service health across the entire system.

## Technical Requirements

- Configure monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, cloud provider monitoring) to regularly poll health check endpoints.
- Integrate health check status into observability dashboards (e.g., Grafana).
- Define alerting rules based on health check status changes.
- Connect health check failures to automated recovery playbooks or CI/CD rollback mechanisms.
- Document the integration of health checks with the observability stack.

## Dependencies

- Health check endpoints implementation (Epic 13, Story 13.8).
- Metrics collection and monitoring (Story 14.5).
- Alerting systems and notification (Story 14.7).

## Priority

High - Ensures proactive detection of service issues and aids in automated recovery.
