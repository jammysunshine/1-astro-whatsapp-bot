# Story 14.9: Distributed Tracing Implementation

## Epic
Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story
As a developer, I want distributed tracing implemented across all microservices so that I can visualize the end-to-end flow of requests, identify latency bottlenecks, and debug issues in complex distributed systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All requests traversing multiple services are traced end-to-end.
- [ ] Traces capture latency, errors, and contextual information for each service hop.
- [ ] The tracing system provides a visual representation of request flows.
- [ ] Developers can easily search and filter traces to diagnose issues.
- [ ] Tracing data is correlated with logs and metrics for a unified observability view.
- [ ] The system helps identify performance bottlenecks and error origins in distributed transactions.

## Technical Requirements
- Select and integrate a distributed tracing system (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin).
- Instrument all microservices and critical components to emit trace data.
- Ensure trace context (e.g., trace ID, span ID) is propagated across service boundaries.
- Configure a trace collector and backend for storage and visualization.
- Integrate tracing data with logging and metrics systems.

## Dependencies
- Structured logging implementation (Story 14.1).
- Metrics collection and monitoring (Story 14.5).
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) (Story 14.6).

## Priority
High - Essential for debugging and optimizing distributed systems.
