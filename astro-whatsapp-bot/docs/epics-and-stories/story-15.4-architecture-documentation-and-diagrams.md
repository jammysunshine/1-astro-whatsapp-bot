Epic 15: Documentation and API Standards

## User Story

As a system architect, I want comprehensive architecture documentation and diagrams so that the system's design, components, and data flows are clearly understood by all stakeholders and development teams.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A dedicated architecture document exists, detailing the system's high-level and low-level design.
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (e.g., context, container, component, deployment) are created and maintained.
- [ ] The documentation clearly explains technology choices, design patterns, and architectural decisions.
- [ ] Data flows and component interactions are clearly illustrated.
- [ ] Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are maintained for significant design choices.
- [ ] The architecture documentation is accessible and regularly updated.

## Technical Requirements

- Define a standard template for architecture documentation.
- Use diagramming tools (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML, draw.io) to create visual representations.
- Document key architectural principles, constraints, and assumptions.
- Establish a process for creating and maintaining ADRs.
- Integrate architecture documentation into the project's documentation portal.

## Dependencies

- System architecture and component design.
- Project overview and goals.

## Priority

Critical - Essential for system understanding and long-term maintainability.
