Epic 15: Documentation and API Standards

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive deployment documentation for all environments so that I can reliably deploy, manage, and troubleshoot the application across development, staging, and production.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detailed deployment guides exist for each environment (dev, staging, production).
- [ ] Documentation includes prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and post-deployment verification.
- [ ] Rollback procedures are clearly documented.
- [ ] The documentation covers CI/CD pipeline usage and environment promotion.
- [ ] The deployment documentation is regularly updated with infrastructure or process changes.
- [ ] The documentation enables new DevOps engineers to perform deployments independently.

## Technical Requirements

- Document the CI/CD pipeline configuration and stages.
- Detail the infrastructure setup for each environment (IaC references).
- Provide instructions for manual deployment steps (if any) and automated deployment triggers.
- Document monitoring and alerting configurations relevant to deployments.
- Include troubleshooting steps for common deployment issues.

## Dependencies

- CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation (Epic 10).
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation (Epic 10, Story 10.8).
