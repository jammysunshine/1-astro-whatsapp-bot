# Story 16.2: Configurable Conversation Flow Engine

## Story Title

Configurable Conversation Flow Engine for Externalized Interaction Paths

## Story Description

As a developer, I want to implement a configurable conversation flow engine so that user interaction paths, prompts, and branching logic can be defined and modified using external configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) rather than hardcoded logic. This will enable rapid iteration on conversation design without requiring code deployments.

## Business Value

- Accelerates iteration on conversation design and user experience.
- Reduces development overhead for modifying interaction flows.
- Allows non-technical stakeholders to contribute to conversation design.
- Minimizes the risk of introducing bugs during conversation flow updates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The conversation engine can load flow definitions from external configuration files.
- [x] User prompts and responses are dynamically generated based on the loaded configuration.
- [x] Branching logic (e.g., based on user input or profile data) is defined within the configuration.
- [x] The engine supports state persistence across user interactions.
- [x] New conversation flows can be activated by updating configuration without code changes.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement a parser for flow configuration files.
- Design a state management system that integrates with the configurable flows.
- Ensure robust error handling for invalid configurations.
- Provide clear logging for conversation flow execution.

## Dependencies

- Core WhatsApp Business API integration.
- User profile and session management.

## Priority

High - Essential for achieving modularity and rapid iteration.
