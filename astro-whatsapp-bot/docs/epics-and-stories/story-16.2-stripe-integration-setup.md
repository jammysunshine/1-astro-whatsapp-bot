# Story 16.2: Stripe Integration Setup

## User Story
As a developer,
I want to set up Stripe integration for international payments,
So that users in UAE and Australia can make real payments via cards.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Stripe account created and API keys configured
2. Payment service updated to use Stripe for UAE/Australia users
3. Card payment methods enabled for international users
4. Existing payment simulation remains functional during setup

## Integration Verification
1. Existing bot functionality continues to work unchanged
2. Payment service maintains current API interface
3. No breaking changes to existing payment flow

## Technical Notes

- Update region detection logic to route UAE/Australia users to Stripe
- Maintain backward compatibility with simulation mode
- Add proper error handling for Stripe API failures
