# Story 16.3: Region-Based Payment Selection

## User Story
As a user,
I want the bot to automatically select the appropriate payment gateway based on my location,
So that I see relevant payment methods for my region.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User region detection implemented (India/UAE/Australia)
2. Payment method selection logic based on region
3. Indian users see UPI/PayTM/card options via Razorpay
4. UAE/Australia users see card options via Stripe
5. Fallback to simulation if region detection fails

## Integration Verification
1. Existing payment flow logic remains intact
2. Bot continues to function for all users
3. No impact on non-payment features

## Technical Notes
- Implement region detection based on user location data
- Update payment method selection UI in bot responses
- Ensure seamless transition between gateways
- Add logging for region detection and gateway selection
