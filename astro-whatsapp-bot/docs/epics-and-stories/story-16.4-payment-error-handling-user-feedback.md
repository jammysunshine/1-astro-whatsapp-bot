# Story 16.4: Payment Error Handling & User Feedback

## User Story
As a user,
I want clear feedback when payment issues occur,
So that I understand what went wrong and how to resolve it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Comprehensive error handling for payment failures
2. User-friendly error messages in bot responses
3. Proper logging of payment errors for debugging
4. Graceful fallback to simulation on payment gateway failures
5. Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Integration Verification
1. Existing error handling patterns maintained
2. Bot stability not affected by payment failures
3. User experience improved without breaking existing flows

## Technical Notes
- Implement try-catch blocks around payment API calls
- Create user-friendly error message templates
- Add payment error logging with context
- Implement retry logic for network failures
- Ensure fallback to simulation mode on critical failures

- [ ] User-friendly error messages added
- [ ] Payment error logging configured
- [ ] Fallback to simulation tested
