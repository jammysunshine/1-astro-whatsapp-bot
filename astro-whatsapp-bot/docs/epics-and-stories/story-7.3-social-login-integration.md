# Story 7.3: Social Login Integration

## User Story

As a user with existing Google or Facebook accounts, I want to link my social accounts to my astrology profile so that I can access the service more easily and recover my account if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Google OAuth 2.0 integration for account linking
- [ ] Facebook Login integration for social authentication
- [ ] Secure storage of social account tokens
- [ ] Account recovery using linked social accounts
- [ ] Profile data synchronization from social accounts (optional)
- [ ] Clear privacy permissions and data usage disclosure
- [ ] Easy unlinking and account management

## Technical Constraints

- OAuth 2.0 compliance and security best practices
- Secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
- WhatsApp integration for social login flows
- Regional compliance with data protection laws

## Security Considerations

- Secure OAuth implementation with PKCE
- No storage of social account passwords
- Proper token refresh and expiration handling
- Audit logging of social login events

## BMAd Compliance

- **Security & Compliance Agent**: Authentication and authorization implementation, secure coding standards enforcement, compliance with regional regulations
- **Quality Assurance & Testing Agent**: Security testing for OAuth flows, API contract testing for social login endpoints
- **Implementation & Development Agent**: Secure integration with social platforms, error handling for authentication failures

## Enterprise Artifacts Produced

- Security documentation with OAuth flow diagrams and security measures
- API documentation for social login endpoints with authentication requirements
- Compliance documentation for social data handling and privacy laws
- Testing documentation with security validation procedures

## BMAd Phase Integration

- **AI-First Development**: Qwen CLI implements secure OAuth flows with enterprise patterns
- **Rapid Prototyping**: AI-driven rapid creation of social login integration with security validation
- **Continuous Learning**: Authentication patterns analyzed for security anomaly detection
- **Coordinated AI Agents**: Security agent leads with QA validation and Implementation integration

## AI Agent Coordination Handoffs

- **System Architect → Security & Compliance**: OAuth architecture and security requirements handed off
- **Security & Compliance → Implementation & Development**: Secure social login implementation handed off
- **Implementation & Development → Quality Assurance**: Social login system handed off for security testing
- **Cross-Epic Dependencies**: Enhances Epic 1 (user profiles) and Epic 11 (compliance)
