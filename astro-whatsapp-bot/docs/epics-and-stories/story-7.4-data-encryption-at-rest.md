# Story 7.4: Data Encryption at Rest

## User Story

As a privacy-conscious user, I want my personal astrology data to be encrypted when stored so that my birth details and readings remain secure even if the database is compromised.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AES-256 encryption for sensitive user data (birth details, readings)
- [ ] Secure key management with rotation policies
- [ ] Transparent encryption/decryption for application access
- [ ] Database-level encryption for critical tables
- [ ] Backup encryption with secure key storage
- [ ] Performance impact assessment and optimization
- [ ] Compliance with regional encryption standards

## Technical Constraints

- Minimal performance impact on database operations
- Secure key storage separate from encrypted data
- Support for database migration and backup scenarios
- WhatsApp integration compatibility

## Security Considerations

- Industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES-256)
- Secure key generation and storage
- Proper key rotation procedures
- Audit logging of encryption operations
