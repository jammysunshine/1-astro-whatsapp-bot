# Story 7.5: Input Validation and Sanitization

## User Story

As a security-focused platform, I want all user inputs to be validated and sanitized so that the astrology service is protected against injection attacks and malicious data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive input validation for all user inputs (birth data, messages, forms)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- [ ] XSS protection with proper output encoding
- [ ] File upload validation with type, size, and content checks
- [ ] JSON schema validation for API inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting for input submission
- [ ] Clear error messages for validation failures

## Technical Constraints

- Performance impact minimization
- WhatsApp message format compatibility
- International character set support
- Real-time validation for conversational interface

## Security Considerations

- Defense in depth approach
- Input validation at multiple layers (client, API, database)
- Secure coding practices implementation
- Regular security audits and updates

## BMAd Compliance

- **Security & Compliance Agent**: Input validation and sanitization implementation, secure coding standards enforcement
- **Quality Assurance & Testing Agent**: Security testing for injection vulnerabilities, API contract testing with malformed inputs
- **Implementation & Development Agent**: Secure input handling implementation, error handling for validation failures

## Enterprise Artifacts Produced

- Security documentation with input validation architecture
- API documentation with validation requirements and error responses
- Testing documentation with security test cases for injection attacks
- Compliance documentation for secure coding standards

## BMAd Phase Integration

- **AI-First Development**: Qwen CLI implements comprehensive input validation with security patterns
- **Rapid Prototyping**: AI-driven rapid validation implementation with security testing
- **Continuous Learning**: Input pattern analysis for anomaly detection
- **Coordinated AI Agents**: Security agent leads with QA validation and Implementation integration

## AI Agent Coordination Handoffs

- **System Architect → Security & Compliance**: Input validation architecture and security requirements handed off
- **Security & Compliance → Implementation & Development**: Validation implementation handed off for integration
- **Implementation & Development → Quality Assurance**: Validation system handed off for comprehensive testing
- **Cross-Epic Dependencies**: Critical for all epics handling user inputs (Epic 1, 2, 3, etc.)
