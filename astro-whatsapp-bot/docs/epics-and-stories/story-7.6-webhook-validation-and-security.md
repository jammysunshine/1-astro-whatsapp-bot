# Story 7.6: Webhook Validation and Security

## User Story

As a **Security Analyst**, I want to implement comprehensive webhook validation and security measures so that all incoming webhooks from WhatsApp Business API and payment gateways are authenticated and validated to prevent unauthorized access and data tampering.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Webhook endpoints validate incoming requests using HMAC signatures
- [ ] Implement timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- [ ] Add request size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- [ ] Validate webhook payload structure and required fields
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for invalid webhooks
- [ ] Log all webhook activities for security monitoring
- [ ] Support multiple webhook sources (WhatsApp, payment providers)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for webhook endpoints

## Business Value

Ensures secure communication with external services, prevents data breaches, and maintains system integrity.

## Technical Details

- **API Endpoints**: `/webhooks/whatsapp`, `/webhooks/payments`
- **Security Measures**: HMAC-SHA256 validation, timestamp checks, payload verification
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting for security events
- **Compliance**: Meets OWASP security standards and regional compliance requirements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Webhook validation implemented and tested
- [ ] Security monitoring and logging in place
- [ ] Documentation updated with security protocols
- [ ] Penetration testing completed for webhook endpoints

## BMAd Agent Coordination
