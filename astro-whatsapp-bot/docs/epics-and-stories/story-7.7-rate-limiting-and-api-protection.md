# Story 7.7: Rate Limiting and API Protection

## User Story

As a **Security Analyst**, I want to implement comprehensive rate limiting and API protection mechanisms so that the system is protected against abuse, DoS attacks, and excessive resource consumption while maintaining service availability for legitimate users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement sliding window rate limiting for all API endpoints
- [ ] Configure different rate limits for different user tiers (Free, Essential, Premium, VIP)
- [ ] Add IP-based rate limiting with whitelist/blacklist functionality
- [ ] Implement user-based rate limiting with progressive throttling
- [ ] Add request queuing for burst traffic handling
- [ ] Configure appropriate rate limits for WhatsApp messaging (24-hour window compliance)
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation under high load
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for rate limit violations

## Business Value

Prevents system abuse, ensures fair resource allocation, maintains service reliability, and protects against malicious attacks.

## Technical Details

- **Rate Limiting Strategy**: Token bucket algorithm with Redis backend
- **Limits Configuration**:
  - Free tier: 100 requests/hour
  - Essential: 500 requests/hour
  - Premium: 2000 requests/hour
  - VIP: 5000 requests/hour
- **Monitoring**: Real-time rate limit tracking and violation alerts
- **Compliance**: WhatsApp Business API rate limit compliance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Rate limiting implemented across all endpoints
- [ ] User tier-based limits configured and tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard for rate limit metrics
- [ ] Load testing completed to validate protection mechanisms

## BMAd Agent Coordination

- **Qwen CLI**: Implement rate limiting logic and Redis integration
- **Gemini CLI**: Performance optimization and code review
- **Security Agent**: Security validation and threat modeling
- **QA Agent**: Load testing and performance validation

## Enterprise Artifacts

- Security Architecture Document: Rate limiting implementation details
- Performance Test Report: Load testing results and capacity analysis
- Monitoring Setup: Rate limiting metrics and alerting configuration
- Compliance Report: API protection compliance validation
