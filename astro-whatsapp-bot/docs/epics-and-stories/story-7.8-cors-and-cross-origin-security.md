# Story 7.8: CORS and Cross-Origin Security

## User Story
As a **Security Analyst**, I want to implement proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies and cross-origin security measures so that web applications can securely interact with the API while preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests and protecting against CORS-based attacks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configure CORS policies for web application domains
- [ ] Implement proper preflight request handling
- [ ] Add origin validation with whitelist of allowed domains
- [ ] Configure appropriate headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, etc.)
- [ ] Implement secure credential handling for cross-origin requests
- [ ] Add CORS headers for API endpoints used by web/mobile clients
- [ ] Validate CORS implementation against security best practices
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for CORS violations

## Business Value
Enables secure cross-platform functionality while protecting against cross-origin attacks and maintaining data security.

## Technical Details
- **Allowed Origins**: Configurable whitelist for web app domains
- **Supported Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
- **Credentials**: Secure handling of authentication cookies/tokens
- **Headers**: Proper CORS header configuration for all endpoints
- **Monitoring**: CORS violation logging and alerting

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CORS policies configured and tested
- [ ] Cross-origin security validated
- [ ] Web application integration tested
- [ ] Security audit completed for CORS implementation

## BMAd Agent Coordination
- **Qwen CLI**: Implement CORS middleware and security policies
- **Gemini CLI**: Code review and optimization
- **Security Agent**: CORS security validation and best practices review
- **QA Agent**: Cross-platform integration testing
