# Story 7.9: API Authentication and Authorization

## User Story
As a **Security Analyst**, I want to implement robust API authentication and authorization mechanisms so that all API endpoints are properly secured with role-based access control and secure token management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
- [ ] Add role-based authorization (User, Premium, Admin roles)
- [ ] Configure secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Implement API key authentication for service-to-service communication
- [ ] Add OAuth 2.0 integration for social login
- [ ] Implement proper session management and timeout handling
- [ ] Add authorization middleware for all protected endpoints
- [ ] Validate token integrity and prevent token tampering

## Business Value
Ensures secure API access, protects user data, enables proper user management, and supports multi-tier service access.

## Technical Details
- **Authentication Methods**: JWT tokens, API keys, OAuth 2.0
- **Authorization Levels**: Public, User, Premium, VIP, Admin
- **Token Management**: Secure storage, automatic refresh, expiration handling
- **Session Security**: Secure session handling with proper timeouts
- **Monitoring**: Authentication failure logging and suspicious activity alerts

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Authentication system implemented and tested
- [ ] Authorization policies configured for all endpoints
- [ ] Token management system operational
- [ ] Security testing completed for authentication mechanisms

## BMAd Agent Coordination
- **Qwen CLI**: Implement authentication and authorization logic
- **Gemini CLI**: Security code review and optimization
- **Security Agent**: Authentication security validation
- **QA Agent**: Authentication flow testing and validation
