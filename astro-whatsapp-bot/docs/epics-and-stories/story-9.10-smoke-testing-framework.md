# Story 9.10: Smoke Testing Framework

## Epic

Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story

As a QA engineer, I want an automated smoke testing framework that runs before full test suites so that I can quickly catch major failures and ensure the basic functionality of the application is intact.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A suite of smoke tests is defined and implemented.
- [ ] Smoke tests cover the most critical functionalities of the application.
- [ ] Smoke tests run automatically and quickly at the beginning of the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] The pipeline fails immediately if any smoke test fails.
- [ ] Test reports clearly indicate smoke test results.
- [ ] Smoke tests are lightweight and provide rapid feedback on build health.

## Technical Requirements

- Identify the absolute critical paths and functionalities for smoke testing.
- Implement simple, fast-executing tests for these critical paths.
- Integrate smoke tests as the first stage in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Ensure smoke tests have minimal dependencies and are highly stable.
- Document the scope and purpose of smoke tests.

## Dependencies

- Core application functionality.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority

High - Provides rapid feedback on build stability.
