# Story 9.11: API Contract Testing

## Epic

Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story

As a developer, I want automated API contract testing to ensure that API endpoints maintain consistency and adhere to their defined specifications, preventing breaking changes between frontend and backend services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API contract tests are implemented for all critical API endpoints.
- [ ] Tests validate request and response schemas, data types, and required fields.
- [ ] Contract tests run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] The pipeline fails if any API contract is violated.
- [ ] Test reports clearly indicate contract discrepancies.
- [ ] Contract definitions are versioned and easily accessible.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and integrate an API contract testing tool (e.g., Pact, OpenAPI/Swagger tools).
- Define API contracts using a standardized format (e.g., OpenAPI Specification).
- Implement contract tests that validate both provider and consumer sides.
- Integrate contract tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Establish a process for updating and managing API contracts.

## Dependencies

- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Frontend and backend services.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority

High - Ensures API stability and prevents integration issues.
