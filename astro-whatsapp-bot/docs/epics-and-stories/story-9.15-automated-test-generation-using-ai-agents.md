# Story 9.15: Automated Test Generation using AI Agents

## Epic

Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story

As a developer, I want AI tools to assist in generating test cases for complex business logic so that I can accelerate test creation and improve test coverage without manual effort.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI agents can generate unit test cases for new or modified code.
- [ ] AI agents can suggest integration test scenarios based on API contracts.
- [ ] AI-generated tests adhere to project coding standards and best practices.
- [ ] The generated tests are accurate and effectively validate the intended functionality.
- [ ] The process of AI-assisted test generation is integrated into the development workflow.
- [ ] AI-generated tests contribute to achieving the 95%+ test coverage goal.

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate AI code generation tools (e.g., Qwen CLI, Gemini CLI) with testing frameworks.
- Develop prompts and guidelines for AI agents to generate high-quality tests.
- Implement a review process for AI-generated tests to ensure correctness and adherence to standards.
- Train AI models on project-specific code patterns and testing methodologies.
- Automate the execution and reporting of AI-generated tests.

## Dependencies

- AI code generation tools (Qwen CLI, Gemini CLI).
- Unit, integration, and E2E testing frameworks.
- Project coding standards and testing guidelines.

## Priority

Medium - Accelerates test creation and improves coverage.
