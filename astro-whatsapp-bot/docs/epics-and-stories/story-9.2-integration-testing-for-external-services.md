# Story 9.2: Integration Testing for External Services

## Epic
Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story
As a developer, I want automated integration tests for all external service integrations so that I can ensure reliable communication and data exchange with third-party APIs and services.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration tests are implemented for all external service calls (e.g., WhatsApp API, Payment Gateways, Astrology APIs).
- [ ] Tests verify correct request/response formats and data mapping.
- [ ] Tests handle various scenarios including success, failure, and edge cases.
- [ ] Integration tests run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Mocking is used for external services to ensure test isolation and speed where appropriate.
- [ ] Test reports clearly indicate the status of external service integrations.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement an integration testing framework.
- Develop test doubles (mocks, stubs) for external services.
- Configure test environments for integration testing.
- Define clear test data strategies for integration tests.
- Integrate integration tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Dependencies
- Core application codebase.
- External service integrations (WhatsApp API, Payment Gateways, Astrology APIs).
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority
Critical - Ensures reliability of external dependencies.
