# Story 9.3: End-to-End Testing for Critical User Flows

## Epic

Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story

As a QA engineer, I want automated end-to-end tests for all critical user flows, **utilizing real libraries and API calls (not mocks)**, so that I can ensure the entire system functions correctly from the user's perspective and prevent regressions in key business processes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] End-to-end tests are implemented for all critical user journeys (e.g., user registration, subscription purchase, astrology reading request), **utilizing real libraries and API calls for all external integrations (e.g., WhatsApp API, database, astrology libraries), minimizing mocks.**
- [ ] Tests simulate real user interactions across all integrated components.
- [ ] Tests validate data consistency and system state changes throughout the flow.
- [ ] End-to-end tests run automatically in a dedicated test environment.
- [ ] Test reports provide clear pass/fail status for each user flow.
- [ ] Tests are resilient to minor UI changes and focus on functionality.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure an end-to-end testing framework (e.g., Playwright, Cypress).
- Set up a dedicated test environment that mirrors production.
- Develop robust test scripts that simulate user behavior.
- Implement data setup and teardown procedures for E2E tests.
- Integrate E2E tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Dependencies

- Core application codebase.
- All integrated services and UI components.
- Dedicated test environment.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority

Critical - Validates core business processes and user experience.
