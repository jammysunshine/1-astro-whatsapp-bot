# Story 9.4: Runtime Testing for Real-World Scenarios

## Epic

Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story

As a QA engineer, I want automated runtime tests that validate real-world user scenarios and business flows so that I can ensure the system behaves as expected under actual operating conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Runtime tests are implemented for key user scenarios and business flows.
- [ ] Tests validate the system's behavior with realistic data and usage patterns.
- [ ] Tests cover complex interactions and edge cases that might occur in production.
- [ ] Runtime tests are executed in a staging or pre-production environment.
- [ ] Test results provide insights into system stability and correctness in real-world conditions.
- [ ] Tests are designed to catch issues that might be missed by unit or integration tests.

## Technical Requirements

- Develop a framework for defining and executing runtime tests.
- Utilize production-like data or synthetic data that mimics real usage.
- Integrate runtime tests into the CI/CD pipeline for automated execution.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for runtime test failures.
- Ensure tests can be easily updated as business flows evolve.

## Dependencies

- Deployed application in a staging/pre-production environment.
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority

High - Validates system behavior in production-like environments.
