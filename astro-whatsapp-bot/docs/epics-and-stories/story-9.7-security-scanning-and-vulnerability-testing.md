# Story 9.7: Security Scanning and Vulnerability Testing

## Epic

Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story

As a security engineer, I want automated security scanning and vulnerability testing integrated into the development workflow so that potential security flaws are identified and addressed early in the development lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is performed on code changes.
- [ ] Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is performed on deployed applications.
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning is integrated to detect known vulnerabilities in libraries.
- [ ] Security scans run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities are reported and block deployments.
- [ ] Security test reports are generated and accessible.

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Bandit) into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Integrate DAST tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Nessus) for staging environments.
- Implement dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, npm audit) in the build process.
- Configure security policies and thresholds for blocking builds.
- Provide guidance on how to remediate common vulnerabilities.

## Dependencies

- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.
- Deployed application in a staging environment.
- Codebase and dependency management.

## Priority

Critical - Ensures application security and compliance.
