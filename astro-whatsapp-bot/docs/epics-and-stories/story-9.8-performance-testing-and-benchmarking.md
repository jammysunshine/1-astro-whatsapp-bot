# Story 9.8: Performance Testing and Benchmarking

## Epic

Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story

As a performance engineer, I want automated performance testing and benchmarking for critical operations so that I can ensure the application meets performance requirements and identify bottlenecks early.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Performance tests are implemented for critical API endpoints and user flows.
- [ ] Benchmarks are established for response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
- [ ] Performance tests run automatically in a dedicated environment.
- [ ] The CI/CD pipeline reports performance regressions.
- [ ] Performance test reports provide clear metrics and comparisons against benchmarks.
- [ ] Tests simulate expected load and stress conditions.

## Technical Requirements

- Select and configure a performance testing tool (e.g., JMeter, k6, Artillery).
- Define performance test scenarios and load profiles.
- Set up a dedicated performance testing environment.
- Integrate performance tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Implement monitoring for performance metrics during tests.

## Dependencies

- Critical API endpoints and user flows.
- Dedicated performance testing environment.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure.

## Priority

High - Ensures application scalability and user satisfaction.
