# CORRECTED COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT PLAN (BMAD AGENT REVIEW APPROVED)

## Project Goal

Create an advanced, comprehensive multi-channel astrology service platform that starts with a fully comprehensive WhatsApp-based service as the primary channel and expands to additional platforms, positioning itself as a Personal Cosmic Coach—your trusted guide for clarity, confidence, and control in uncertain times. The platform will provide hyper-personalized astrological readings, predictive life coaching, and subscription-based services focused on delivering emotional ROI—not just information but actionable insights that help users navigate life with confidence. The platform will support multiple astrology systems (Hindu, Western, Chinese, Tarot, Numerology, Palmistry, and more), innovative subscription tiers (Essential, Premium, VIP), one-time services, real astrologer chat functionality, predictive decision-timing features, and regional payment options for India, UAE, and Australia. The platform will feature an AI Twin system, Astro-Social Network, and advanced personalization to create an indispensable daily engagement experience that drives high retention and revenue growth through proven viral growth mechanisms.
