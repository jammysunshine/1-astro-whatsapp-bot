# Technology Stack Recommendations (Solo Developer - Rapid 2-3 Day Development with BMAd AI-Driven Approach)

## Rapid Development Strategy (2-3 Days Focus)

- **Leverage AI Agents**: Maximum use of Qwen CLI and Gemini CLI for code generation, testing, and deployment
- **Pre-built Components**: Use existing libraries and services wherever possible to accelerate development
- **Modular Architecture**: Build in independent, testable modules that can be developed in parallel
- **API-First Approach**: Integrate third-party services for complex functionality (astrology calculations, payments, etc.)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use serverless and managed services to avoid infrastructure setup time
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test generation by AI to ensure quality without manual testing

## Backend Services (Rapid Implementation)

- Node.js/Express.js or Python/FastAPI for server-side logic (quick setup with AI-generated code)
- WhatsApp Business API for messaging (pre-built integration libraries)
- Payment gateways (Razorpay for India, Stripe for international) - fully managed services
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for user data and visualizations
- Real-time chat functionality using WebSocket libraries (Socket.io)
- User database with PostgreSQL/MySQL (managed services like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- **Social Graph Database**: Simple relationship tracking using standard database tables initially
- **Loyalty System Engine**: Simple points tracking initially, expandable later
- **AI Twin System**: Use OpenAI API or similar for initial AI interactions, optimize later
- **Transit Timing Engine**: Integrate with existing astrology API services initially

## Solo Developer AI Infrastructure (Maximize Efficiency)

- **Qwen CLI as Primary**: Primary development agent for architecture, code generation, and implementation
- **Gemini CLI as Secondary**: Secondary development agent for optimization, refactoring, and code review
- **AI Pair Programming**: Use both AI agents in coordination for faster problem solving
- **Automated Testing Generation**: AI-generated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **AI Code Review**: Continuous code quality checks using AI agents
- **Automated Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines with AI-generated deployment scripts
- **AI Monitoring**: Intelligent error detection and performance monitoring

## Database

- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for user profiles and preferences
- Redis for caching and session management
- Elasticsearch for search functionality
- Time-series database for tracking user engagement patterns across platforms
- **Relationship Graph Database**: For tracking compatibility and social connections between users
- **Loyalty Points Database**: For managing user points, rewards, and tier levels

## Third-Party Integrations

- Multiple payment providers based on region
- Astrology calculation libraries/APIs
- SMS service for OTP verification
- Email service for receipts and notifications
- Multi-channel notification service (SMS, push, email)
- **Social Media APIs**: For enhanced sharing capabilities

## Multi-Language Technology Stack

- Translation APIs (Google Cloud Translation, AWS Translate)
- Natural Language Processing for local language queries
- Internationalization (i18n) framework
- Localization tools for content adaptation
- Multi-language text-to-speech for voice interactions
- Unicode support for various scripts (Devanagari, Arabic, etc.)

## BMAd Development Tools

- **AI Agent Orchestration**: Coordinated development using multiple AI agents (Qwen CLI and Gemini CLI)
- **Automated Testing Pipeline**: Continuous testing with AI-generated test cases
- **CI/CD with AI Validation**: Automated deployment with AI quality checks
- **BMAd Project Management**: AI-assisted task prioritization and progress tracking
- **Qwen CLI and Gemini CLI Coordination**: Seamless switching between tools for optimal results

## Multi-Channel Delivery System

- WhatsApp-first architecture with abstraction layer for other platforms
- Web app framework (React/Vue.js) for web interface
- Mobile app framework (React Native/Flutter) for mobile apps
- Content management system for cross-platform content delivery
- Kundli/kundli visualization engine for multiple formats
- File sharing and storage system for birth charts and reports
- Real-time synchronization across all user touchpoints
- **Social Features Engine**: For compatibility checking, community building, and sharing
