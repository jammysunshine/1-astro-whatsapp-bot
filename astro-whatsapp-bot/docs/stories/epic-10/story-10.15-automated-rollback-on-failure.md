# Story 10.15: Automated Rollback on Failure

## Epic
Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want automated rollback mechanisms that trigger on deployment failure or critical health check alerts so that the application automatically reverts to a stable state without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The deployment pipeline automatically initiates a rollback if deployment steps fail.
- [ ] Rollback is triggered automatically if post-deployment health checks fail.
- [ ] The system reverts to the last known stable version of the application.
- [ ] Automated notifications are sent when an automatic rollback occurs.
- [ ] The rollback process is fast and minimizes service disruption.
- [ ] The automated rollback mechanism is regularly tested and proven reliable.

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate rollback commands or scripts into the CI/CD pipeline's error handling.
- Configure monitoring systems to trigger rollbacks based on critical alerts (e.g., health check failures, high error rates).
- Ensure versioning of deployable artifacts to facilitate easy rollback.
- Implement safeguards to prevent cascading failures during rollback.
- Document the conditions that trigger automated rollbacks.

## Dependencies
- Rollback procedures documentation and implementation (Story 10.5).
- Automated health checks with alerting (Story 10.14).
- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).

## Priority
Critical - Ensures system stability and rapid recovery from failures.
