Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story
As a developer, I want a clear error classification and handling strategy so that different types of errors (e.g., client, server, transient) are processed appropriately, leading to better user experience and system recovery.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Errors are classified into distinct categories (e.g., operational, programming, transient, business).
- [ ] Specific handling mechanisms are defined for each error type.
- [ ] User-facing error messages are appropriate for the error type and do not expose sensitive information.
- [ ] The application distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors.
- [ ] Error handling logic is consistent across the application.
- [ ] The system can gracefully recover from known error conditions.

## Technical Requirements
- Define a standardized error object or structure for the application.
- Implement custom error classes for different error types.
- Develop a centralized error handling middleware or service.
- Map internal error codes to external, user-friendly messages.
- Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems to track error types and frequencies.

## Dependencies
- Comprehensive error logging and context (Story 13.5).
- User-friendly error messages (Story 13.15).

## Priority
High - Improves system stability and user experience during errors.
