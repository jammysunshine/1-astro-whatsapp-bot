# Story 14.12: Real-time Log Streaming

## Epic
Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story
As a developer, I want real-time log streaming capabilities so that I can monitor application behavior live, quickly identify emerging issues, and debug problems as they occur in production or staging environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application logs are streamed in real-time to the centralized logging solution.
- [ ] Developers can view live log streams for specific services or environments.
- [ ] The streaming mechanism is efficient and does not introduce significant latency.
- [ ] Real-time log views support filtering and searching.
- [ ] The system provides immediate visibility into application events and errors.
- [ ] Real-time log streaming aids in rapid incident detection and response.

## Technical Requirements
- Configure log shippers to stream logs continuously (e.g., Fluentd, Logstash, cloud-native log agents).
- Integrate with a real-time log viewing interface in the centralized logging solution.
- Ensure the log streaming infrastructure is robust and handles backpressure effectively.
- Implement secure access to real-time log streams.
- Document how to access and utilize real-time log streaming.

## Dependencies
- Centralized logging solution (Story 14.2).
- Structured logging implementation (Story 14.1).

## Priority
High - Essential for live debugging and rapid incident response.
