Epic 15: Documentation and API Standards

## User Story
As a lead developer, I want clear and consistent code documentation standards defined and enforced so that the codebase is uniformly documented, improving readability, maintainability, and onboarding for new developers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A comprehensive set of code documentation standards is defined (e.g., JSDoc, Python docstrings, JavaDoc).
- [ ] All developers adhere to the defined standards for inline documentation and comments.
- [ ] Automated tools (e.g., linters, static analysis) check for compliance with documentation standards.
- [ ] Code reviews include checks for documentation quality and consistency.
- [ ] The standards cover naming conventions, comment formats, and documentation content requirements.
- [ ] The documentation standards are easily accessible and understood by all team members.

## Technical Requirements
- Select a documentation standard appropriate for each programming language used in the project.
- Create a style guide or documentation guidelines document.
- Configure linters or static analysis tools to enforce documentation standards.
- Provide training and examples to developers on how to apply the standards.
- Integrate documentation generation tools (e.g., Sphinx, JSDoc) where applicable.

## Dependencies
- Inline documentation and code comments (Story 15.3).
- Codebase.

## Priority
High - Ensures consistent and high-quality code documentation.
