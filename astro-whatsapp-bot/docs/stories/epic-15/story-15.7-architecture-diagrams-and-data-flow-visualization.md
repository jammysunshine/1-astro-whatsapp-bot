# Story 15.7: Architecture Diagrams and Data Flow Visualization

## Epic
Epic 15: Documentation and API Standards

## User Story
As a system architect, I want clear and up-to-date architecture diagrams and data flow visualizations so that all stakeholders can easily understand the system's structure, component interactions, and how data moves through the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive architecture diagrams (e.g., context, container, component, deployment) are created and maintained.
- [ ] Data flow diagrams clearly illustrate how data is processed and exchanged between components.
- [ ] Diagrams are consistent with the architecture documentation and actual system implementation.
- [ ] Diagrams are easily accessible and rendered using standard tools (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML).
- [ ] Diagrams are updated whenever significant architectural changes occur.
- [ ] The visualizations aid in onboarding new team members and troubleshooting.

## Technical Requirements
- Select and standardize on diagramming tools and formats (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML, C4 model).
- Create initial set of architecture and data flow diagrams.
- Integrate diagram generation or rendering into the documentation pipeline.
- Establish a process for reviewing and updating diagrams with architectural changes.
- Store diagram source code (e.g., Mermaid markdown) in version control.

## Dependencies
- Architecture documentation and diagrams (Story 15.4).
- Version control system.

## Priority
High - Improves understanding of complex system designs.
