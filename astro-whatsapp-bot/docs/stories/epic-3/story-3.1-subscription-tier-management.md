## BMAd Compliance
- **Product Manager Agent**: Business requirements analysis for subscription model, solution validation for tier structure, impact assessment for revenue generation, prioritized feature backlogs for monetization features
- **System Architect Agent**: Data architecture specifications for subscription tiers and user entitlements, API contract specifications for tier management endpoints, security foundations for payment data protection
- **Implementation & Development Agent**: Feature implementation with enterprise design patterns for subscription logic, system integration with payment gateways, error handling for subscription failures, logging and monitoring for revenue tracking
- **Security & Compliance Agent**: Data encryption for subscription and payment information, compliance with payment industry standards, principle of least privilege for subscription data access
- **Quality Assurance & Testing Agent**: Automated testing for subscription logic, API testing for tier management, security testing for payment data handling, regression testing for feature access control

## Enterprise Artifacts Produced
- Requirements documentation with functional and non-functional requirements for subscription system
- Architecture documentation with subscription data models and API contracts
- Security documentation with compliance measures for payment processing
- API documentation with OpenAPI specifications for subscription management
- Testing documentation with validation procedures for tier access

## BMAd Phase Integration
- **AI-First Development**: Product Manager Agent drives requirements analysis with business value assessment for revenue optimization
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick iteration on subscription models through AI-powered prototyping and user validation cycles
- **Continuous Learning**: Adaptive learning from subscription metrics to optimize tier structures and pricing strategies
- **Coordinated AI Agents**: Handoff from Product Manager (requirements) to System Architect (design) to Implementation (development)

## AI Agent Coordination Handoffs
- **Product Manager → System Architect**: Revenue requirements and business rules handed off for technical design
- **System Architect → Implementation & Development**: Subscription data models and API contracts handed off for development
- **Implementation & Development → Security & Compliance**: Payment logic handed off for security validation
- **Cross-Epic Dependencies**: Integrates with Epic 1 (user profiles) and Epic 2 (astrology features) for tier-based access control
