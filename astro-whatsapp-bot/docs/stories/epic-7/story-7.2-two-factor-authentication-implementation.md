# Story 7.2: Two-Factor Authentication Implementation

## User Story
As a security-focused user, I want to enable two-factor authentication so that my astrology account is protected with an additional layer of security beyond just my WhatsApp number.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SMS-based 2FA option available for account verification
- [ ] Email-based 2FA as backup authentication method
- [ ] QR code setup for authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- [ ] Backup codes generated and securely stored for account recovery
- [ ] 2FA enforcement for sensitive operations (payment, profile changes)
- [ ] Graceful fallback when 2FA service is unavailable
- [ ] User-friendly setup and management interface

## Technical Constraints
- Must work within WhatsApp's conversational interface
- Secure storage of 2FA secrets and backup codes
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse of 2FA requests
- Compliance with regional data protection laws

## Security Considerations
- Secure transmission of 2FA codes
- No storage of plaintext 2FA secrets
- Proper session management with 2FA validation
- Audit logging of 2FA events

## BMAd Compliance
- **Security & Compliance Agent**: Authentication and authorization implementation, input validation and sanitization, secure coding standards enforcement
- **Quality Assurance & Testing Agent**: Security testing and vulnerability testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline, API contract testing for authentication endpoints
- **Deployment & Infrastructure Agent**: Secure deployment with environment-specific configuration for 2FA services

## Enterprise Artifacts Produced
- Security documentation with authentication flow diagrams
- API documentation for 2FA endpoints with security requirements
- Compliance documentation for regional data protection laws
- Testing documentation with security test cases and validation procedures

## BMAd Phase Integration
- **AI-First Development**: Qwen CLI implements secure 2FA algorithms with enterprise security patterns
- **Rapid Prototyping**: AI-driven rapid creation of 2FA flows with immediate security validation
- **Continuous Learning**: Security monitoring learns from authentication patterns to detect anomalies
- **Coordinated AI Agents**: Handoff between Security (implementation) and QA (validation) agents

## AI Agent Coordination Handoffs
- **System Architect → Security & Compliance**: Authentication architecture and security requirements handed off
- **Security & Compliance → Implementation & Development**: Secure 2FA implementation handed off for integration
- **Implementation & Development → Quality Assurance**: 2FA system handed off for comprehensive security testing
- **Cross-Epic Dependencies**: Provides foundation for Epic 3 (subscription security) and Epic 11 (compliance)
