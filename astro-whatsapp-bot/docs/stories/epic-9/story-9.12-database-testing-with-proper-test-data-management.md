# Story 9.12: Database Testing with Proper Test Data Management

## Epic
Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story
As a database administrator, I want automated database schema, query, and data integrity testing with proper test data management so that I can ensure the reliability and consistency of the data layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated tests validate database schema changes and migrations.
- [ ] Tests verify the correctness of complex database queries and stored procedures.
- [ ] Data integrity constraints are automatically tested.
- [ ] A robust test data management strategy is implemented (e.g., seeding, anonymization).
- [ ] Database tests run automatically in a dedicated test environment.
- [ ] Test reports clearly indicate database-related issues.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement a database testing framework (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase for migrations; custom scripts for data).
- Develop scripts for automated schema validation and data integrity checks.
- Create tools or scripts for generating and managing realistic test data.
- Configure a dedicated, isolated database instance for testing.
- Integrate database tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Dependencies
- Database system (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Database schema and migration scripts.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority
High - Ensures data reliability and consistency.
