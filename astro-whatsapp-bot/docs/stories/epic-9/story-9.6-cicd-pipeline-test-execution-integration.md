# Story 9.6: CI/CD Pipeline Test Execution Integration

## Epic
Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want all automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) to be integrated and executed within the CI/CD pipeline so that every code change is thoroughly validated before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests are automatically triggered and executed on every code commit.
- [ ] Integration tests are automatically triggered and executed after successful unit tests.
- [ ] End-to-end tests are automatically triggered and executed after successful integration tests.
- [ ] The CI/CD pipeline fails if any test suite reports failures.
- [ ] Test results are clearly reported and accessible within the CI/CD system.
- [ ] Test execution is optimized for speed within the pipeline.

## Technical Requirements
- Configure CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to run all test suites.
- Define stages for unit, integration, and E2E test execution.
- Ensure proper environment setup for each test stage within the pipeline.
- Implement caching mechanisms to speed up test execution.
- Configure test reporting tools to publish results.

## Dependencies
- Unit testing framework.
- Integration testing framework.
- End-to-end testing framework.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority
Critical - Ensures continuous quality and prevents regressions.
