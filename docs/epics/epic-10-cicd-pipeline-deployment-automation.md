# Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## Description
Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated deployment and quality gates following BMAD methodology and gemini.md mandates. This epic is CRITICAL for solo developer success as it eliminates all manual deployment burden and ensures zero-defect deployments through automated quality gates.

## Features Included
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing suite
- Continuous integration with automated test execution
- Continuous deployment with quality gates
- Automated deployment pipeline with zero manual intervention
- Rollback procedures documentation and implementation
- Environment promotion strategies with quality gates
- Deployment automation scripts for all environments
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation
- Automated provisioning and configuration management
- Release management and versioning with semantic versioning
- Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime releases
- Canary release strategy for gradual rollouts
- Zero-downtime deployment with health checks
- Automated health checks with alerting
- Automated rollback on failure with monitoring
