## Features Included
- Automated CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Continuous deployment with quality gates
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Rollback procedures documentation
- Environment promotion strategies
- Deployment automation scripts
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation
- Automated provisioning and configuration
- Release management and versioning
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Canary release strategy
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Automated health checks
- Automated rollback on failure
