# Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## Description
Implement comprehensive security framework with dependency scanning and compliance following BMAD methodology and gemini.md mandates. This epic is ESSENTIAL for solo developer success as it eliminates security vulnerabilities and ensures compliance with zero manual security review burden.

## Features Included
- Security framework implementation
- Dependency scanning and vulnerability detection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Webhook validation and signature verification
- Rate limiting and DoS protection
- CORS configuration and security headers
- Data encryption (In transit and at rest)
- Principle of least privilege implementation
- Security headers configuration
- File upload validation and malware scanning
- API key management and rotation
- Compliance with regional regulations
- GDPR compliance implementation
- Data privacy and protection measures

## Business Value
ESSENTIAL for solo developer success - eliminates security vulnerabilities and ensures compliance with zero manual security review burden.
