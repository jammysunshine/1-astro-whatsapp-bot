## Dev Notes
### Architecture Context
- **WhatsApp Business API Integration**: This story directly relates to "Media handling for kundli sharing" and "Message processing and response generation" for delivering multi-format content.
- **Multi-Channel Delivery System**: This story implements aspects of "Content Management: Content management system for cross-platform content delivery", "Visualization: Kundli/kundli visualization engine for multiple formats", and "File Sharing: File sharing and storage system for birth charts and reports".
- **Multi-Language Technology Stack**: "TTS: Multi-language text-to-speech for voice interactions" is directly relevant for accessibility.
- **Storage**: Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) will be used for storing generated images and videos.

### Implementation Guidance
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Integrate a TTS engine (e.g., cloud-based TTS APIs) to convert text responses into voice notes. Ensure support for multiple languages.
- **Image/Video Generation**: Implement services for generating visual content like birth charts (kundli images) and delivering pre-recorded video content for premium features. Optimize image generation for various platforms.
- **Accessibility Features**: Develop high contrast UI modes and ensure generated content is compatible with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Implement alt text generation for all visual content.
- **Content Management**: Utilize a multi-language content management system to manage simplified language options and localized content for accessibility.
- **Modularity**: Design each accessibility and multi-format delivery feature as a modular component for independent development and future enhancements.

## Testing
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write unit tests for TTS integration, image/video generation, and accessibility feature implementations *before* writing the code.
- **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions for text-to-speech conversion, image/video generation logic, and alt text generation.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the delivery of multi-format content via WhatsApp and its compatibility with user preferences.
- **Accessibility Tests**: Include automated and manual accessibility checks (e.g., screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation) for generated content.
- **Acceptance Criteria Validation**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are covered by automated tests, including testing with different content formats and accessibility settings.

## Dev Agent Record
- **Agent Model Used**: Gemini CLI (Dev Persona)
