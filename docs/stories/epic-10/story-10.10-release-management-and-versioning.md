Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story
As a release manager, I want a clear release management and versioning strategy so that application releases are tracked, managed, and easily identifiable, ensuring proper control over software delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A semantic versioning strategy is applied to all application releases.
- [ ] Release artifacts are tagged and stored in a versioned repository.
- [ ] Release notes are automatically generated based on commit history.
- [ ] The release process is documented and followed consistently.
- [ ] Rollback to previous versions is straightforward and supported.
- [ ] The current version of the application is easily identifiable in all environments.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement semantic versioning (e.g., using tools like `standard-version` or `semantic-release`).
- Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically tag releases and generate release notes.
- Store immutable build artifacts in a secure repository.
- Integrate with a change log management system.
- Ensure version information is accessible within the running application.

## Dependencies
- Automated CI/CD pipeline configuration (Story 10.1).
- Version control system (Git).
- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).

## Priority
High - Ensures traceability and control over software releases.
