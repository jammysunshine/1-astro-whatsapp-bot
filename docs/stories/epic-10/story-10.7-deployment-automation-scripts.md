Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Automation

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want a comprehensive set of deployment automation scripts so that application deployments are standardized, repeatable, and minimize human error.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scripts exist for deploying all application components (backend, frontend, database, etc.).
- [ ] Scripts are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
- [ ] Scripts handle environment-specific configurations and secrets securely.
- [ ] Scripts are version-controlled and reviewed.
- [ ] Execution of scripts is integrated into the automated deployment pipeline.
- [ ] Scripts provide clear output and logging for troubleshooting.

## Technical Requirements
- Develop deployment scripts using a chosen language/tool (e.g., Bash, Python, Ansible).
- Ensure scripts are modular and reusable.
- Implement error handling and logging within the scripts.
- Integrate with secret management solutions for sensitive data.
- Document the usage and parameters of each script.

## Dependencies
- Automated deployment pipeline (Story 10.4).
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation (Story 10.8).
- Automated provisioning and configuration management (Story 10.9).

## Priority
High - Ensures consistent and error-free deployments.
