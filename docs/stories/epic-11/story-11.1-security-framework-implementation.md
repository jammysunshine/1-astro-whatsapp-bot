Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security architect, I want a comprehensive security framework implemented across the application so that all components are protected against common threats and vulnerabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A foundational security framework is integrated into the application architecture.
- [ ] Security policies and best practices are defined and enforced.
- [ ] All new features are developed with security considerations from the outset.
- [ ] The framework provides common security utilities (e.g., secure random number generation, password hashing).
- [ ] Security configurations are centralized and manageable.
- [ ] The framework supports future security enhancements and audits.

## Technical Requirements
- Select and integrate a security framework or library appropriate for the tech stack.
- Define secure coding guidelines and conduct developer training.
- Implement a security review process for all code changes.
- Centralize security-related configurations (e.g., TLS settings, cipher suites).
- Ensure the framework is scalable and maintainable.

## Dependencies
- Core application architecture.
- Development team adherence to security guidelines.

## Priority
Critical - Establishes the foundation for application security.
