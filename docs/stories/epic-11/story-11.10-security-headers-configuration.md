# Story 11.10: Security Headers Configuration

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security engineer, I want essential security headers configured for all web responses so that the application is protected against common browser-based attacks and enhances user privacy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header is implemented to enforce HTTPS.
- [ ] X-Frame-Options header is configured to prevent clickjacking.
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options header is set to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks.
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks.
- [ ] Referrer-Policy header is configured to control referrer information leakage.
- [ ] Feature-Policy (or Permissions-Policy) header is used to restrict browser features.

## Technical Requirements
- Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or application framework (e.g., Express.js) to send appropriate security headers.
- Define a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) that whitelists trusted sources for content.
- Implement HSTS with a suitable max-age and includeSubDomains directive.
- Regularly review and update security header configurations to adapt to new threats.
- Test the effectiveness of implemented security headers using browser developer tools or online scanners.

## Dependencies
- Web application server.
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).

## Priority
High - Enhances browser security and user privacy.
