# Story 11.12: API Key Management and Rotation

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security administrator, I want a secure API key management system with automated rotation capabilities so that access to external services is controlled, and the risk of compromised keys is minimized.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All API keys for external services are securely stored and managed.
- [ ] Automated rotation of API keys is implemented for critical services.
- [ ] Access to API keys is restricted based on the principle of least privilege.
- [ ] Compromised API keys can be quickly revoked and replaced.
- [ ] The system logs all API key access and usage.
- [ ] Documentation exists for API key management policies and procedures.

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate with a secret management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, environment variables for development).
- Implement automated scripts or use cloud provider features for API key rotation.
- Define granular access policies for API keys.
- Develop monitoring and alerting for unusual API key usage.
- Ensure API keys are never hardcoded in the codebase.

## Dependencies
- External service integrations.
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).
- Principle of least privilege implementation (Story 11.9).

## Priority
High - Protects access to external services and sensitive data.
