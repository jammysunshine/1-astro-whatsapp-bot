# Story 11.2: Dependency Scanning and Vulnerability Detection

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security engineer, I want automated dependency scanning and vulnerability detection integrated into the CI/CD pipeline so that known security flaws in third-party libraries are identified and remediated promptly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A dependency scanning tool is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] The tool automatically scans all project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Vulnerabilities are reported with severity levels and remediation advice.
- [ ] The CI/CD pipeline fails if critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are detected.
- [ ] A process for regularly updating dependencies and addressing vulnerabilities is established.
- [ ] Security reports are generated and accessible for audit purposes.

## Technical Requirements
- Select and configure a dependency scanning tool (e.g., Snyk, npm audit, OWASP Dependency-Check).
- Integrate the tool into the CI/CD pipeline to run on every build.
- Define policies for acceptable vulnerability levels.
- Automate the process of dependency updates where possible.
- Document the dependency management and vulnerability remediation process.

## Dependencies
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure (Epic 10).
- Project dependency management (e.g., package.json, package-lock.json).

## Priority
Critical - Protects against known vulnerabilities in third-party code.
