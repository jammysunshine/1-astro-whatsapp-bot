# Story 11.5: Webhook Validation and Signature Verification

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security engineer, I want webhook requests to be validated and their signatures verified so that the application only processes legitimate requests from trusted sources and prevents spoofing or tampering.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All incoming webhook requests are validated for authenticity.
- [ ] Cryptographic signature verification is performed for webhook payloads.
- [ ] Requests with invalid or missing signatures are rejected.
- [ ] The application is protected against webhook replay attacks.
- [ ] Webhook secrets are securely stored and managed.
- [ ] Logging captures details of valid and invalid webhook requests for auditing.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement a webhook validation middleware or function.
- Utilize cryptographic libraries to verify request signatures (e.g., HMAC-SHA256).
- Securely store webhook secrets (e.g., in environment variables or a secret manager).
- Implement measures to prevent replay attacks (e.g., timestamp validation, nonce).
- Document the webhook security implementation.

## Dependencies
- Webhook processing system (Epic 1).
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).
- Secret management solution.

## Priority
Critical - Secures communication with external services.
