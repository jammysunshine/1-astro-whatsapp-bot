# Story 11.7: CORS Configuration and Security Headers

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security engineer, I want Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies configured appropriately and essential security headers implemented so that the application is protected against cross-site attacks and browser-based vulnerabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CORS policies are correctly configured to allow only trusted origins to access API resources.
- [ ] Essential security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP) are implemented.
- [ ] The application is protected against common cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking attacks.
- [ ] CORS configuration is flexible enough to support development and production environments.
- [ ] Security headers are applied consistently across all web responses.
- [ ] The configuration is auditable and adheres to security best practices.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement CORS middleware or configuration in the application server (e.g., Express.js CORS middleware).
- Define a whitelist of allowed origins for CORS.
- Configure security headers in the application server or web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
- Regularly review and update security header configurations.

## Dependencies
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).
- Web application server.

## Priority
High - Protects against common web vulnerabilities.
