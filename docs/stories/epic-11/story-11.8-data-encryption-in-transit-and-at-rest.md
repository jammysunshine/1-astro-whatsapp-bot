# Story 11.8: Data Encryption (In Transit and At Rest)

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security architect, I want all sensitive data to be encrypted both in transit and at rest so that user information is protected from unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All data transmitted between clients and servers is encrypted using strong cryptographic protocols (e.g., HTTPS/TLS).
- [ ] All sensitive data stored in databases or file systems is encrypted at rest.
- [ ] Encryption keys are securely managed and rotated.
- [ ] The application uses industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- [ ] Data decryption occurs only by authorized processes.
- [ ] Compliance with data protection regulations requiring encryption is met.

## Technical Requirements
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all network communications.
- Configure database encryption at rest (e.g., AWS RDS encryption, MongoDB encryption).
- Implement file system encryption for sensitive files.
- Utilize a Key Management System (KMS) for secure key generation, storage, and rotation.
- Ensure proper configuration of cryptographic libraries and protocols.

## Dependencies
- Data storage and management systems.
- Network infrastructure.
- Security framework implementation (Story 11.1).

## Priority
Critical - Protects sensitive user data and ensures privacy.
