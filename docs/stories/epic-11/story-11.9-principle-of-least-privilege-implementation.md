# Story 11.9: Principle of Least Privilege Implementation

## Epic
Epic 11: Security and Compliance Framework

## User Story
As a security architect, I want the principle of least privilege to be implemented across all users, services, and systems so that each entity has only the minimum necessary permissions to perform its function, reducing the attack surface.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All application users are assigned roles with only the necessary permissions.
- [ ] Service accounts and API keys have restricted permissions tailored to their specific tasks.
- [ ] Database users have granular access controls, limiting access to only required tables and operations.
- [ ] Cloud resources are configured with the minimum necessary IAM policies.
- [ ] Regular audits are conducted to review and adjust permissions.
- [ ] The system prevents unauthorized escalation of privileges.

## Technical Requirements
- Define granular roles and permissions for application users.
- Configure IAM policies for cloud resources (e.g., AWS IAM, Google Cloud IAM).
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the application.
- Create dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions for inter-service communication.
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions.

## Dependencies
- Authentication and authorization implementation (Story 11.4).
- Cloud infrastructure (Epic 10).
- Database system.

## Priority
High - Reduces the impact of security breaches and unauthorized access.
