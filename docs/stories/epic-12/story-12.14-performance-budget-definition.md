Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a product manager, I want a clear performance budget defined for critical metrics so that performance is treated as a first-class citizen throughout the development process and maintained over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A performance budget is defined for key metrics (e.g., page load time, response time, bundle size, memory usage).
- [ ] The budget includes specific, measurable thresholds for each metric.
- [ ] Automated tools track adherence to the performance budget in the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] The CI/CD pipeline fails if the performance budget is exceeded.
- [ ] The performance budget is regularly reviewed and updated.
- [ ] Development teams are aware of and design within the defined performance budget.

## Technical Requirements
- Identify critical performance metrics relevant to user experience and business goals.
- Establish baseline performance measurements.
- Configure CI/CD tools (e.g., Lighthouse CI, Webpack Bundle Analyzer) to monitor performance metrics.
- Integrate performance budget checks into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Document the performance budget and communicate it to all stakeholders.

## Dependencies
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure (Epic 10).
- Performance testing and benchmarking (Epic 9, Story 9.8).

## Priority
High - Ensures performance is a continuous focus and prevents regressions.
