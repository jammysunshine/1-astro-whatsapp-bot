# Story 12.2: Caching Strategies (In-Memory, Redis)

## Epic
Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a developer, I want to implement effective caching strategies using both in-memory and Redis caches so that frequently accessed data is served quickly, reducing database load and improving response times.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] In-memory caching is implemented for application-specific, short-lived data.
- [ ] Redis caching is implemented for shared, more persistent, and scalable data.
- [ ] Cache hit rates are tracked and optimized.
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategies are defined and implemented to ensure data freshness.
- [ ] The application demonstrates reduced latency for cached data requests.
- [ ] Database load is significantly reduced for operations involving cached data.

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate an in-memory caching library (e.g., `node-cache`, `Guava Cache` equivalent).
- Set up and configure a Redis instance.
- Implement caching logic for frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, astrology calculations).
- Define cache keys, expiration policies, and eviction strategies.
- Develop mechanisms for manual and automated cache invalidation.

## Dependencies
- Redis infrastructure.
- Database system.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority
Critical - Significantly improves application performance and scalability.
