## Epic
Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a developer, I want connection pooling implemented for database and external API connections so that connection overhead is minimized, improving performance and resource utilization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database connections utilize a connection pool.
- [ ] Connections to external APIs (e.g., WhatsApp API, Astrology APIs) utilize connection pooling where applicable.
- [ ] Connection establishment overhead is significantly reduced.
- [ ] Resource utilization for connections is optimized.
- [ ] The application maintains stable performance under varying load conditions related to connections.
- [ ] Connection pool metrics (e.g., active connections, wait times) are monitored.

## Technical Requirements
- Configure database drivers or ORMs to use connection pooling.
- Implement or configure connection pooling for HTTP clients used for external API calls.
- Define optimal pool sizes and connection timeout settings.
- Ensure proper connection release and error handling within the pool.
- Monitor connection pool performance and adjust configurations as needed.

## Dependencies
- Database system.
- External API integrations.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority
High - Improves resource efficiency and application responsiveness.
