Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a developer, I want proper memory management and garbage collection patterns implemented so that the application avoids memory leaks, reduces resource consumption, and maintains stable performance over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The application demonstrates stable memory usage over extended periods, indicating no significant memory leaks.
- [ ] Resource allocation and deallocation are handled efficiently.
- [ ] Garbage collection cycles are optimized to minimize impact on application responsiveness.
- [ ] Tools for memory profiling and leak detection are integrated into the development workflow.
- [ ] Critical components are reviewed for potential memory-intensive operations.
- [ ] The application operates within defined memory limits.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement best practices for memory management in the chosen language/runtime (e.g., proper object disposal, avoiding global variables, efficient data structures).
- Utilize memory profiling tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Valgrind, YourKit) to detect and diagnose leaks.
- Optimize garbage collection settings where configurable.
- Conduct regular code reviews focusing on resource management.
- Document common memory-related pitfalls and solutions.

## Dependencies
- Core application codebase.
- Code profiling and bottleneck identification (Story 12.6).

## Priority
Medium - Prevents memory-related performance degradation and crashes.
