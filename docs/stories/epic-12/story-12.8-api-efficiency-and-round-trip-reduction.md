Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a developer, I want API interactions to be optimized for efficiency and round trip reduction so that network latency is minimized and application responsiveness is improved.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The number of API calls required for common user operations is minimized.
- [ ] API payloads are optimized to transfer only necessary data.
- [ ] Batch operations are implemented for scenarios requiring multiple data updates or retrievals.
- [ ] Network round trips for critical user flows are reduced.
- [ ] The application demonstrates improved responsiveness due to efficient API usage.
- [ ] API usage patterns are monitored for inefficiencies.

## Technical Requirements
- Design APIs to support efficient data fetching (e.g., GraphQL, sparse fieldsets, includes).
- Implement batching or bulk endpoints for multiple resource operations.
- Optimize API response structures to reduce payload size.
- Utilize HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for multiplexing requests where applicable.
- Implement client-side caching for API responses.
- Conduct API performance testing to identify and optimize inefficient calls.

## Dependencies
- API design and implementation.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority
High - Directly impacts user experience and network resource usage.
