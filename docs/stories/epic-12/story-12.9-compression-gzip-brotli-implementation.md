# Story 12.9: Compression (gzip/Brotli) Implementation

## Epic
Epic 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want data compression (gzip/Brotli) implemented for all network traffic so that bandwidth usage is reduced, and application load times are improved.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All HTTP responses (e.g., API responses, static assets) are compressed using gzip or Brotli.
- [ ] The application demonstrates reduced data transfer sizes over the network.
- [ ] Page load times for web clients are measurably improved.
- [ ] Compression is applied efficiently without significant CPU overhead on the server.
- [ ] Compression is configured correctly for different client capabilities.
- [ ] Network traffic monitoring confirms effective compression rates.

## Technical Requirements
- Configure web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or application frameworks (e.g., Express.js) to enable gzip or Brotli compression.
- Ensure compression is applied to appropriate content types (e.g., JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Test compression effectiveness using browser developer tools or network analysis tools.
- Monitor server CPU usage to ensure compression does not introduce performance regressions.
- Document compression configurations and best practices.

## Dependencies
- Web application server.
- Network infrastructure.
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection (Story 12.15).

## Priority
High - Reduces bandwidth costs and improves user experience.
