# Story 13.10: Error Recovery and Auto-Healing

## Epic
Epic 13: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want automated error recovery and auto-healing mechanisms implemented so that the application can automatically detect and resolve common issues, minimizing downtime and manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The application automatically detects common error conditions (e.g., service restarts, database connection drops).
- [ ] Automated mechanisms attempt to recover from detected errors (e.g., restarting failed services, re-establishing connections).
- [ ] Auto-healing processes are non-disruptive to active users where possible.
- [ ] Recovery attempts and outcomes are logged and monitored.
- [ ] The system can differentiate between transient and persistent failures to avoid infinite recovery loops.
- [ ] The application demonstrates improved uptime and reduced mean time to recovery (MTTR).

## Technical Requirements
- Implement health monitoring agents that can trigger recovery actions.
- Develop scripts or services for automated restarts of failed components.
- Configure container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) for self-healing capabilities.
- Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems to track recovery events.
- Define clear recovery playbooks for common failure scenarios.

## Dependencies
- Health check endpoints implementation (Story 13.8).
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (Epic 14).
- Automated deployment pipeline (Epic 10).

## Priority
High - Improves system availability and reduces operational burden.
