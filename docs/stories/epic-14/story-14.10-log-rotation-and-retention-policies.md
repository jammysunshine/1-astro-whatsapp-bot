# Story 14.10: Log Rotation and Retention Policies

## Epic
Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want automated log rotation and retention policies implemented so that log storage is managed efficiently, compliance requirements are met, and historical data is available for analysis without consuming excessive resources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Log files are automatically rotated based on size or time intervals.
- [ ] Log data is retained for a defined period (e.g., 30 days, 90 days, 1 year) according to compliance requirements.
- [ ] Older log data is automatically archived or deleted after its retention period.
- [ ] The log rotation and retention process is non-disruptive to application operations.
- [ ] Log storage costs are optimized.
- [ ] Documentation exists for log retention policies and procedures.

## Technical Requirements
- Configure log rotation utilities (e.g., `logrotate` for Linux, built-in logging framework features).
- Implement archiving mechanisms for long-term storage of historical logs (e.g., S3, cold storage).
- Define and enforce log retention policies in the centralized logging solution.
- Ensure secure deletion of logs after their retention period.
- Monitor log storage usage and costs.

## Dependencies
- Centralized logging solution (Story 14.2).
- Log security and access control (Story 14.11).

## Priority
High - Ensures efficient log management and compliance.
