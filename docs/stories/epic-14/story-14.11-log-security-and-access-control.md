# Story 14.11: Log Security and Access Control

## Epic
Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story
As a security administrator, I want robust log security and access control implemented so that sensitive information in logs is protected, and only authorized personnel can view or modify log data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Access to raw log data and the centralized logging solution is restricted based on roles and permissions.
- [ ] Sensitive information (e.g., PII, passwords) is redacted or masked in logs before storage.
- [ ] All access to log data is audited and logged.
- [ ] The integrity of log data is protected against tampering.
- [ ] Compliance with data privacy regulations regarding log data is maintained.
- [ ] Security incidents related to log access are alerted upon.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for the centralized logging platform.
- Configure log redaction or masking rules for sensitive data fields.
- Encrypt logs at rest and in transit.
- Implement audit logging for all access to the logging system.
- Integrate with identity and access management (IAM) systems.
- Document log security policies and procedures.

## Dependencies
- Centralized logging solution (Story 14.2).
- Structured logging implementation (Story 14.1).
- Data privacy and protection measures (Epic 11, Story 11.15).

## Priority
Critical - Protects sensitive data and ensures compliance.
