# Story 14.6: Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

## Epic
Epic 14: Observability and Logging Infrastructure

## User Story
As a developer, I want Application Performance Monitoring (APM) integrated into the application so that I can gain deep insights into code-level performance, transaction tracing, and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] An APM tool is integrated into the application.
- [ ] The APM tool provides end-to-end transaction tracing across services.
- [ ] Code-level performance bottlenecks are identified (e.g., slow database queries, inefficient function calls).
- [ ] User experience metrics (e.g., page load times, frontend errors) are captured.
- [ ] Alerts are triggered for performance anomalies or errors detected by the APM.
- [ ] The APM provides dashboards and reports for performance analysis.

## Technical Requirements
- Select and integrate an APM solution (e.g., Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace, OpenTelemetry).
- Instrument application code with APM agents or SDKs.
- Configure transaction tracing to span across microservices and external calls.
- Set up custom dashboards and alerts for key application performance indicators.
- Integrate APM data with logs and metrics for a unified observability view.

## Dependencies
- Metrics collection and monitoring (Story 14.5).
- Structured logging implementation (Story 14.1).
- Distributed tracing implementation (Story 14.9).

## Priority
Critical - Provides deep visibility into application performance and user experience.
