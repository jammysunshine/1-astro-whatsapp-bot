## User Story
As a project manager, I want a detailed change log maintained for the application so that I can track significant changes, feature additions, and bug fixes across different releases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A change log (e.g., CHANGELOG.md) is maintained and updated with each release.
- [ ] Entries clearly describe new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes.
- [ ] The change log follows a consistent format (e.g., Keep a Changelog standard).
- [ ] The change log is easily accessible to users and stakeholders.
- [ ] The change log helps in understanding the evolution of the application.
- [ ] Automated tools assist in generating or updating change log entries.

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate change log updates into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Dependencies
