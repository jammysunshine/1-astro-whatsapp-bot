Epic 15: Documentation and API Standards

## User Story
As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation generated using OpenAPI/Swagger so that I can easily understand and integrate with the application's API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All API endpoints are documented using OpenAPI Specification (OAS).
- [ ] The documentation includes request/response examples, error codes, and authentication requirements.
- [ ] The API documentation is automatically generated and kept up-to-date with code changes.
- [ ] A user-friendly interface (e.g., Swagger UI) is available for exploring the API.
- [ ] The documentation clearly defines API contracts and data models.
- [ ] The API documentation is accessible to internal and external consumers.

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate an OpenAPI/Swagger generation tool into the build process.
- Annotate API endpoints in code with OAS-compatible comments or decorators.
- Configure Swagger UI or a similar tool for interactive API exploration.
- Establish a process for reviewing and validating API documentation.
- Ensure API documentation is versioned along with the API itself.

## Dependencies
- API design and implementation.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure (Epic 10).

## Priority
Critical - Essential for API consumers and maintainability.
