Epic 15: Documentation and API Standards

## User Story
As a developer, I want clear and concise inline documentation and code comments for complex logic, algorithms, and business rules so that the codebase is easily understandable and maintainable by other developers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All public functions, classes, and modules have appropriate inline documentation (e.g., JSDoc, Python docstrings).
- [ ] Complex algorithms and business rules are explained with comments.
- [ ] Code comments focus on *why* a piece of code exists, not *what* it does.
- [ ] Documentation adheres to established code documentation standards.
- [ ] Code reviews include checks for documentation quality and completeness.
- [ ] The codebase is self-documenting where possible, with comments used for non-obvious logic.

## Technical Requirements
- Define and enforce code documentation standards (e.g., JSDoc, Sphinx, Doxygen).
- Integrate static analysis tools to check for missing or malformed documentation.
- Provide examples of good and bad comments/documentation.
- Conduct training for developers on effective code commenting practices.
- Ensure documentation is updated with code changes.

## Dependencies
- Code documentation standards (Story 15.6).
- Codebase.

## Priority
High - Improves code readability and maintainability.
