Epic 15: Documentation and API Standards

## User Story
As a developer, I want clear and precise API contract documentation so that I can understand the exact specifications of API endpoints, ensuring seamless integration and preventing breaking changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API contracts are documented for all internal and external APIs.
- [ ] Documentation includes request/response schemas, data types, validation rules, and error formats.
- [ ] API contract documentation is versioned along with the API itself.
- [ ] The documentation is easily accessible and machine-readable (e.g., OpenAPI Specification).
- [ ] Changes to API contracts are clearly communicated and documented.
- [ ] The documentation serves as the single source of truth for API behavior.

## Technical Requirements
- Utilize OpenAPI Specification (OAS) or similar standard for API contract definition.
- Integrate contract definition into the API development workflow.
- Generate human-readable documentation from OAS files (e.g., using Swagger UI).
- Establish a process for reviewing and approving API contract changes.
- Ensure backward compatibility is considered when updating API contracts.

## Dependencies
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger (Story 15.2).
- API design and implementation.

## Priority
High - Ensures stable API integrations and reduces development friction.
