# Story 16.3: Dynamic Menu Management System

## Story Title
Dynamic Menu Management System for Flexible User Interface

## Story Description
As a developer, I want to implement a dynamic menu management system so that interactive menu options (buttons, lists) can be defined, updated, and registered through configuration or an administrative interface, allowing for flexible and rapid changes to the user interface without code modifications.

## Business Value
- Enables quick updates to menu options and user navigation.
- Reduces development time for UI changes.
- Allows non-technical users to manage menu content.
- Supports A/B testing of different menu layouts and options.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Menu definitions (text, options, associated actions) are stored externally (e.g., configuration files, database).
- [x] The system can dynamically render interactive menus based on the current user context and loaded configurations.
- [x] New menu options can be added or existing ones modified without code changes.
- [x] A central service handles menu navigation and dispatches actions based on user selections.
- [x] Supports different types of interactive menus (buttons, lists).

## Technical Requirements
- Design a schema for menu configuration.
- Implement a menu rendering component that interprets the configuration.
- Create a mechanism for registering and retrieving menus.
- Ensure menu actions are decoupled from menu presentation.

## Dependencies
- Core WhatsApp Business API integration.
- User profile and session management.
- Configurable Conversation Flow Engine (Story 16.2).

## Priority
High - Crucial for flexible user interaction and rapid UI updates.
