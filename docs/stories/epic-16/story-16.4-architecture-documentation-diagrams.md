# Story 16.4: Architecture Documentation and Diagrams

## Epic
Epic 16: Documentation and API Standards Suite

## User Story
As a developer, I want comprehensive architecture documentation and diagrams with data flow so that I can understand, extend, and maintain the system architecture with confidence and zero ambiguity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Architecture documentation and diagrams with data flow
- [ ] System architecture overview with component relationships
- [ ] Data flow diagrams with request/response paths
- [ ] Microservices architecture with service boundaries
- [ ] Database schema with entity relationships
- [ ] API gateway and routing documentation
- [ ] Security architecture with authentication flow
- [ ] Performance architecture with caching strategies
- [ ] Scalability architecture with load balancing
- [ ] Error handling architecture with fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Monitoring architecture with observability patterns
- [ ] Deployment architecture with infrastructure diagrams
- [ ] CI/CD architecture with pipeline flows
- [ ] Testing architecture with coverage strategies

## Technical Requirements
- Comprehensive system architecture documentation
- Visual architecture diagrams with clear labeling
- Data flow diagrams with request/response paths
- Component relationship mapping with dependencies
- Service boundary definitions with interfaces
- Database entity relationship diagrams
- API gateway routing documentation
- Authentication flow diagrams
- Caching strategy diagrams
- Load balancing architecture
- Fallback mechanism diagrams
- Observability pattern documentation
- Infrastructure diagrams with components
- CI/CD pipeline flow diagrams
