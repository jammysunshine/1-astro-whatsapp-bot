# Story 16.4: Independent Conversation Modules

## Story Title
Independent Conversation Modules for Isolated Feature Development

## Story Description
As a developer, I want to implement each distinct conversation flow or feature as an independent, self-contained module so that it can be developed, tested, and deployed in isolation, minimizing dependencies and ensuring that changes to one module do not inadvertently affect others.

## Business Value
- Enables parallel development of multiple features.
- Reduces the risk of introducing regressions when modifying existing functionality.
- Simplifies debugging and troubleshooting by isolating issues to specific modules.
- Facilitates easier onboarding for new developers by allowing them to focus on single modules.
- Supports independent deployment of features, enabling faster release cycles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each conversation flow (e.g., onboarding, horoscope request, compatibility check) is encapsulated within its own module.
- [ ] Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces or a central dispatcher.
- [ ] Module-specific state management does not interfere with other modules.
- [ ] Unit tests for each module can run independently without external dependencies.
- [ ] New modules can be added to the system with minimal changes to existing core logic.

## Technical Requirements
- Define a clear module structure and interface guidelines.
- Implement a mechanism for modules to register themselves with the conversation engine.
- Ensure proper dependency injection or inversion of control for module dependencies.
- Design for isolated error handling within each module.

## Dependencies
- Configurable Conversation Flow Engine (Story 16.2).
- Dynamic Menu Management System (Story 16.3).

## Priority
High - Fundamental for achieving the overall modular architecture.
