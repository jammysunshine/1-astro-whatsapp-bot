- [ ] Rate limiting and DoS protection with automated blocking
- [ ] CORS configuration and security headers with proper implementation
- [ ] Data encryption (In transit and at rest) with industry standards
- [ ] Principle of least privilege implementation with role-based access
- [ ] Security headers configuration with best practices
- [ ] File upload validation and malware scanning with automated detection
- [ ] API key management and rotation with automated processes
- [ ] Compliance with regional regulations (India, UAE, Australia)
- [ ] GDPR compliance implementation with data protection
- [ ] Data privacy and protection measures with user consent
- [ ] Dependency scanning and vulnerability testing
- [ ] Security scanning and compliance validation
- [ ] Automated security scanning and vulnerability detection
- [ ] Security compliance with dependency scanning
- [ ] Enterprise-grade security with compliance frameworks
- [ ] Security practices with compliance requirements
