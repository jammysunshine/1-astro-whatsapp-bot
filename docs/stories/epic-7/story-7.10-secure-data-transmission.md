# Story 7.10: Secure Data Transmission

## User Story
As a **Security Analyst**, I want to implement end-to-end encryption for all data transmission so that user data is protected during transit and communication with external services is secure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all API endpoints
- [ ] Configure proper SSL/TLS certificates with auto-renewal
- [ ] Add encryption for sensitive data in transit (birth details, payment info)
- [ ] Implement secure communication with WhatsApp Business API
- [ ] Add encryption for payment gateway integrations
- [ ] Configure secure webhook communication with external services
- [ ] Implement certificate pinning for mobile applications
- [ ] Add monitoring for SSL/TLS handshake failures

## Business Value
Protects user privacy, ensures secure financial transactions, maintains regulatory compliance, and builds user trust.

## Technical Details
- **Encryption Standards**: TLS 1.3, AES-256 encryption
- **Certificate Management**: Let's Encrypt with auto-renewal
- **Secure Protocols**: HTTPS for all endpoints, secure WebSocket for real-time features
- **Payment Security**: PCI DSS compliant encryption for payment data
- **Monitoring**: SSL certificate expiry alerts and security monitoring

## Definition of Done
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS implemented across all services
- [ ] SSL certificates configured and monitored
- [ ] Data transmission encryption validated
- [ ] Security audit completed for data in transit
