# Story 7.15: Security Testing and Vulnerability Management

## User Story
As a **Security Tester**, I want to implement automated security testing and vulnerability management processes so that security vulnerabilities are identified and remediated before they can be exploited.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST)
- [ ] Configure vulnerability assessment tools and processes
- [ ] Add penetration testing procedures and scheduling
- [ ] Implement security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure vulnerability tracking and remediation workflows
- [ ] Add security code review processes
- [ ] Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Configure security testing reports and dashboards

## Business Value
Reduces security risks, ensures proactive vulnerability management, maintains security posture, and prevents potential breaches.
