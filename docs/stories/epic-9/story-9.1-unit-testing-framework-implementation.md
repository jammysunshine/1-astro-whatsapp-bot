# Story 9.1: Unit Testing Framework Implementation

## Epic
Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story
As a developer, I want a robust unit testing framework with 95%+ code coverage so that I can ensure the correctness of individual code components and prevent regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit testing framework is integrated into the project.
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit tests.
- [ ] Existing codebase achieves at least 95% unit test coverage.
- [ ] Unit tests run automatically on every commit.
- [ ] Test reports clearly indicate coverage percentage and failed tests.
- [ ] Unit tests are isolated and do not have external dependencies.

## Technical Requirements
- Select and configure a suitable unit testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Vitest).
- Implement a code coverage tool (e.g., Istanbul, c8).
- Integrate unit tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Develop guidelines for writing effective unit tests.
- Ensure tests are fast and provide quick feedback.

## Dependencies
- Core application codebase.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority
Critical - Foundation for automated quality assurance.
