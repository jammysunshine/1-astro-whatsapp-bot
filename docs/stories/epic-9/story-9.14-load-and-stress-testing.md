# Story 9.14: Load and Stress Testing

## Epic
Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story
As a performance engineer, I want automated load and stress testing to ensure the system performs reliably under expected and peak user traffic, preventing outages and performance degradation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated load tests simulate expected user concurrency and transaction volumes.
- [ ] Stress tests determine the system's breaking point and behavior under extreme load.
- [ ] Tests measure response times, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization under load.
- [ ] Load and stress tests run automatically in a dedicated performance environment.
- [ ] Test reports clearly identify performance bottlenecks and scalability limits.
- [ ] The system maintains acceptable performance under defined load conditions.

## Technical Requirements
- Select and configure a load testing tool (e.g., JMeter, k6, Locust).
- Define realistic load profiles and test scenarios.
- Set up a dedicated, isolated environment for load and stress testing.
- Integrate load tests into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous performance validation.
- Implement monitoring to capture system metrics during load tests.

## Dependencies
- Deployed application in a performance test environment.
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

## Priority
High - Ensures scalability and reliability under traffic.
