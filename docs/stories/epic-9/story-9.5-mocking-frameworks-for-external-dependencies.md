# Story 9.5: Mocking Frameworks for External Dependencies

## Epic
Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story
As a developer, I want comprehensive mocking frameworks for all external dependencies so that I can write fast, reliable, and isolated tests without relying on actual external services.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A mocking framework is integrated and configured for the project.
- [ ] All external APIs and services can be effectively mocked or stubbed.
- [ ] Tests can simulate various responses from external dependencies (success, failure, latency).
- [ ] Mocking is used consistently across unit and integration tests where appropriate.
- [ ] Documentation exists for how to use the mocking framework.
- [ ] Mocked responses accurately reflect the behavior of real external services.

## Technical Requirements
- Select and integrate a suitable mocking library (e.g., Sinon.js, Mockito, Jest's mocking capabilities).
- Develop reusable mock objects or functions for common external services.
- Implement strategies for managing complex mock scenarios.
- Train developers on best practices for mocking and stubbing.
- Ensure mocks are easily maintainable and up-to-date with API changes.

## Dependencies
- Core application codebase.
- External service integrations.
- Unit and integration testing frameworks.

## Priority
High - Essential for efficient and reliable testing.
