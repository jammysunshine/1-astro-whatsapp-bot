## Epic
Epic 9: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance Suite

## User Story
As a QA engineer, I want an automated regression testing suite that runs on every build so that I can quickly catch any unintended side effects or breakage introduced by new code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A comprehensive regression testing suite is established.
- [ ] The regression suite covers all critical functionalities and existing features.
- [ ] Regression tests run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] The pipeline fails if any regression test fails.
- [ ] Test reports clearly indicate regression failures.
- [ ] The regression suite is regularly maintained and updated with new features.

## Technical Requirements
- Identify and prioritize critical test cases for the regression suite.
- Automate existing manual test cases where feasible.
- Integrate the regression suite into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Ensure the regression suite is stable and reliable.
- Implement a process for updating the regression suite as the application evolves.

## Dependencies
- Unit, integration, and E2E testing frameworks.
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.
- Comprehensive test case repository.

## Priority
Critical - Prevents unintended breakage and ensures stability.
